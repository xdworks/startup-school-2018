**Introduction**

Startup companies need to purchase equipment, rent offices, and hire
staff. More importantly, they need to grow. In almost every case they
will require outside capital to do these things.

The initial capital raised by a company is typically called "seed"
capital. This brief guide is a summary of what startup founders need to
know about raising the seed funds critical to getting their company off
the ground.

This is not intended to be a complete guide to fundraising. It includes
only the basic knowledge most founders will need. The information comes
from my experiences working at startups, investing in startups, and
advising startups at Y Combinator and Imagine K12. YC partners naturally
gain a lot of fundraising experience and YC founder Paul Graham (PG) has
written extensively on the
topic [1](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e1), [2](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e2), [3](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e3), [4](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e4).
His essays cover in more detail much of what is contained in this guide
and are highly recommended reading.

**Why Raise Money?**

Without startup funding the vast majority of startups will die. The
amount of money needed to take a startup to profitability is usually
well beyond the ability of founders and their friends and family to
finance. A startup here means a company that is built to grow
fast [12](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e12).
High growth companies almost always need to burn capital to sustain
their growth prior to achieving profitability. A few startup companies
do successfully bootstrap (self-fund) themselves, but they are the
exception. Of course, there are lots of great companies that aren't
startups. Managing capital needs for such companies is not covered
herein.

Cash not only allows startups to live and grow, a war chest is also
almost always a competitive advantage in all ways that matter: hiring
key staff, public relations, marketing, and sales. Thus, most startups
will almost certainly want to raise money. The good news is that there
are lots of investors hoping to give the right startup money. The bad
news is, "Fundraising is
brutal" [1](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e1).
The process of raising that money is often long, arduous, complex, and
ego deflating. Nevertheless, it is a path almost all companies and
founders must walk, but when is the time right to raise?

**When to Raise Money**

Investors write checks when the idea they hear is compelling, when they
are persuaded that the team of founders can realize its vision, and that
the opportunity described is real and sufficiently large. When founders
are ready to tell this story, they can raise money. And usually when you
can raise money, you should.

For some founders it is enough to have a story and a reputation.
However, for most it will require an idea, a product, and some amount of
customer adoption, a.k.a. traction. Luckily, the software development
ecosystem today is such that a sophisticated web or mobile product can
be built and delivered in a remarkably short period of time at very low
cost. Even hardware can be rapidly prototyped and tested.

But investors also need persuading. Usually a product they can see, use,
or touch will not be enough. They will want to know that there is
product market fit and that the product is experiencing actual growth.

Therefore, founders should raise money when they have figured out what
the market opportunity is and who the customer is, and when they have
delivered a product that matches their needs and is being adopted at an
interestingly rapid rate. How rapid is interesting? This depends, but a
rate of 10% per week for several weeks is impressive. And to raise money
founders need to impress. For founders who can convince investors
without these things, congratulations. For everyone else, work on your
product and talk to your users.

**How Much to Raise?**

Ideally, you should raise as much money as you need to reach
profitability, so that you'll never have to raise money again. If you
succeed in this, not only will you find it easier to raise money in the
future, you'll be able to survive without new funding if the funding
environment gets tight. That said, certain kinds of startups will need a
follow-on round, such as those building hardware. Their goal should be
to raise as much money as needed to get to their next "fundable"
milestone, which will usually be 12 to 18 months later.

In choosing how much to raise you are trading off several variables,
including how much progress that amount of money will purchase,
credibility with investors, and dilution. If you can manage to give up
as little as 10% of your company in your seed round, that is wonderful,
but most rounds will require up to 20% dilution and you should try to
avoid more than 25%. In any event, the amount you are asking for must be
tied to a believable plan. That plan will buy you the credibility
necessary to persuade investors that their money will have a chance to
grow. It is usually a good idea to create multiple plans assuming
different amounts raised and to carefully articulate your belief that
the company will be successful whether you raise the full or some lesser
amount. The difference will be how fast you can grow.

One way to look at the optimal amount to raise in your first round is to
decide how many months of operation you want to fund. A rule of thumb is
that an engineer (the most common early employee for Silicon Valley
startups) costs all-in about \$15k per month. So, if you would like to
be funded for 18 months of operations with an average of five engineers,
then you will need about 15k x 5 x 18 = \$1.35mm. What if you are
planning to hire for other positions as well? Don't worry about it! This
is just an estimate and will be accurate enough for whatever mix you
hire. And here you have a great answer to the question: "How much are
you raising?" Simply answer that you are raising for N months (usually
12-18) and will thus need \$X, where X will usually be between \$500k
and \$1.5 million. As noted above, you should give multiple versions of
N and a range for X, giving different possible growth scenarios based on
how much you successfully raise.

There is enormous variation in the amount of money raised by companies.
Here we are concerned with early raises, which usually range from a few
hundreds of thousands of dollars up to two million dollars. Most first
rounds seem to cluster around six hundred thousand dollars, but largely
thanks to increased interest from investors in seed, these rounds have
been increasing in size over the last several years.

**Financing Options**

Startup founders must understand the basic concepts behind venture
financing. It would be nice if this was all very simple and could be
explained in a single paragraph. Unfortunately, as with most legal
matters, that's not possible. Here is a very high level summary, but it
is worth your time to read more about the details and pros and cons of
various types of financing and, importantly, the key terms of such deals
that you need to be aware of, from preferences to option pools. The
articles below are a decent start.

     Equity](http://venturehacks.com/articles/debt-or-equity)

     Options](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/07/financing-options-convertible-debt.html)

     Debt](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/the-truth-about-convertible-debt-at-startups-and-the-hidden-terms-you-didn-t-understand-9fccf6854dee#.z63i0cy5g)

-   [Announcing the
     Safe](https://ycombinator.wpengine.com/announcing-the-safe-a-replacement-for-convertible-notes)

 Venture financing usually takes place in "rounds," which have
 traditionally had names and a specific order. First comes a seed
 round, then a Series A, then a Series B, then a Series C, and so on to
 acquisition or IPO. None of these rounds are required and, for
 example, sometimes companies will start with a Series A financing
 (almost always an "equity round" as defined below). Recall that we are
 focusing here exclusively on seed, that very first venture round.

 Most seed rounds, at least in Silicon Valley, are now structured as
 either convertible debt or simple agreements for future equity
 (safes) [17](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e17).
 Some early rounds are still done with equity, but in Silicon Valley
 they are now the exception.

 **Convertible Debt**

 Convertible debt is a loan an investor makes to a company using an
 instrument called a convertible note. That loan will have a principal
 amount (the amount of the investment), an interest rate (usually a
 minimum rate of 2% or so), and a maturity date (when the principal and
 interest must be repaid). The intention of this note is that it
 converts to equity (thus, "convertible") when the company does an
 equity financing. These notes will also usually have a "Cap" or
 "Target Valuation" and / or a discount. A Cap is the maximum effective
 valuation that the owner of the note will pay, regardless of the
 valuation of the round in which the note converts. The effect of the
 cap is that convertible note investors usually pay a lower price per
 share compared to other investors in the equity round. Similarly, a
 discount defines a lower effective valuation via a percentage off the
 round valuation. Investors see these as their seed "premium" and both
 of these terms are negotiable. Convertible debt may be called at
 maturity, at which time it must be repaid with earned interest,
 although investors are often willing to extend the maturity dates on
 notes.

 **Safe**

 Convertible debt has been almost completely replaced by the safe at YC
 and Imagine K12. A safe acts like convertible debt without the
 interest rate, maturity, and repayment requirement. The negotiable
 terms of a safe will almost always be simply the amount, the cap, and
 the discount, if any. There is a bit more complexity to any
 convertible security, and much of that is driven by what happens when
 conversion occurs. I strongly encourage you to read the safe
 primer [18](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e18),
 which is available on [YC's
 site](http://www.ycombinator.com/documents/). The primer has several
 examples of what happens when a safe converts, which go a long way
 toward explaining how both convertible debt and safes work in
 practice.

 **Equity**

 An equity round means setting a valuation for your company (generally,
 the cap on the safes or notes is considered as a company's notional
 valuation, although notes and safes can also be uncapped) and thus a
 per-share price, and then issuing and selling new shares of the
 company to investors. This is always more complicated, expensive, and
 time consuming than a safe or convertible note and explains their
 popularity for early rounds. It is also why you will always want to
 hire a lawyer when planning to issue equity.

 To understand what happens when new equity is issued, a simple example
 helps. Say you raise \$1,000,000 on a \$5,000,000 pre-money valuation.
 If you also have 10,000,000 shares outstanding then you are selling
 the shares at:

1.  **\$5,000,000 / 10,000,000 = 50 cents per share**\
     and you will thus sell...

2.  **2,000,000 shares**\
     resulting in a new share total of...

3.  **10,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 12,000,000 shares**\
     and a post-money valuation of...

4.  **\$0.50 \* 12,000,000 = \$6,000,000**\
     and dilution of...

5.  **2,000,000 / 12,000,000 = 16.7%**\
     Not 20%!

 There are several important components of an equity round with which
 you must become familiar when your company does a priced round,
 including equity incentive plans (option pools), liquidation
 preferences, anti-dilution rights, protective provisions, and more.
 These components are all negotiable, but it is usually the case that
 if you have agreed upon a valuation with your investors (next
 section), then you are not too far apart, and there is a deal to be
 done. I won't say more about equity rounds, since they are so uncommon
 for seed rounds.

 One final note: whatever form of financing you do, it is always best
 to use well-known financing documents like YC's safe. These documents
 are well understood by the investor community, and have been drafted
 to be fair, yet founder friendly.

 **Valuation: What is my company worth?**

 You are two hackers with an idea, a few months of hacking's worth of
 software, and several thousand users. What is your company worth? It
 should be obvious that no formula will give you an answer. There can
 only be the most notional sort of justification for any value at all.
 So, how do you set a value when talking to a potential investor? Why
 do some companies seem to be worth \$20mm and some \$4mm? Because
 investors were convinced that was what they were (or will be in the
 near future) worth. It is that simple. Therefore, it is best to let
 the market set your price and to find an investor to set the price or
 cap. The more investor interest your company generates, the higher
 your value will trend.

 Still, it can be difficult in some circumstances to find an investor
 to tell you what you are worth. In this case you can choose a
 valuation, usually by looking at comparable companies who have
 valuations. Please remember that the important thing in choosing your
 valuation is not to over-optimize. The objective is to find a
 valuation with which you are comfortable, that will allow you to raise
 the amount you need to achieve your goals with acceptable dilution,
 and that investors will find reasonable and attractive enough to write
 you a check. Seed valuations tend to range from \$2mm-\$10mm, but keep
 in mind that the goal is not to achieve the best valuation, nor does a
 high valuation increase your likelihood of success.

 **Investors: Angels & Venture Capitalists**

 The difference between an angel and a VC is that angels are amateurs
 and VCs are pros. VCs invest other people's money and angels invest
 their own on their own terms. Although some angels are quite rigorous
 and act very much like the pros, for the most part they are much more
 like hobbyists. Their decision making process is usually much
 faster--they can make the call all on their own--and there is almost
 always a much larger component of emotion that goes into that
 decision.

 VCs will usually require more time, more meetings, and will have
 multiple partners involved in the final decision. And remember, VCs
 see LOTS of deals and invest in very few, so you will have to stand
 out from a crowd.

 The ecosystem for seed (early) financing is far more complex now than
 it was even five years ago. There are many new VC firms, sometimes
 called "super-angels," or "micro-VC's", which explicitly target brand
 new, very early stage companies. There are also several traditional
 VCs that will invest in seed rounds. And there are a large number of
 independent angels who will invest anywhere from \$25k to \$100k or
 more in individual companies. New fundraising options have also
 arisen. For example, [AngelList
 Syndicates](https://angel.co/syndicates) lets angels pool their
 resources and follow a single lead
 angel. [FundersClub](http://www.fundersclub.com/founders) invests
 selectively like a traditional VC, but lets angels become LPs in their
 VC funds to expand connections available to its founders.

 How does one meet and encourage the interest of investors? If you are
 about to present at a demo day, you are going to meet lots of
 investors. There are few such opportunities to meet a concentrated and
 motivated group of seed investors. Besides a demo day, by far the best
 way to meet a venture capitalist or an angel is via a warm
 introduction. Angels will also often introduce interesting companies
 to their own networks. Otherwise, find someone in your network to make
 an introduction to an angel or VC. If you have no other options, do
 research on VCs and angels and send as many as you can a **brief**,
 but compelling summary of your business and opportunity
 (see [Documents You
 Need](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#part12) below).

 **Crowdfunding**

 There are a growing number of new vehicles to raise money, such
 as [AngelList](https://angel.co/), [Kickstarter](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/),
 and [Wefunder](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/).
 These crowdfunding sites can be used to launch a product, run a
 pre-sales campaign, or find venture funding. In exceptional cases,
 founders have used these sites as their dominant fundraising source,
 or as clear evidence of demand. They usually are used to fill in
 rounds that are largely complete or, at times, to reanimate a round
 that is having difficulty getting off the ground. The ecosystem around
 investing is changing rapidly, but when and how to use these new
 sources of funds will usually be determined by your success raising
 through more traditional means.

 **Meeting Investors**

 If you are meeting investors at an investor day, remember that your
 goal is not to close--it is to get the next meeting. Investors will
 seldom choose to commit the first day they hear your pitch, regardless
 of how brilliant it is. So book lots of meetings. Keep in mind that
 the hardest part is to get the first money in the company. In other
 words, meet as many investors as possible but focus on those most
 likely to close. Always optimize for getting money soonest (in other
 words, be
 greedy) [2](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e2).

 There are a few simple rules to follow when preparing to meet with
 investors. First, make sure you know your audience--do research on
 what they like to invest in and try to figure out why. Second,
 simplify your pitch to the essential--why this is a great product
 (demos are almost a requirement nowadays), why you are precisely the
 right team to build it, and why together you should all dream about
 creating the next gigantic company. Next make sure you listen
 carefully to what the investor has to say. If you can get the investor
 to talk more than you, your probability of a deal skyrockets. In the
 same vein, do what you can to connect with the investor. This is one
 of the main reasons to do research. An investment in a company is a
 long term commitment and most investors see lots of deals. Unless they
 like you and feel connected to your outcome, they will most certainly
 not write a check.

 Who you are and how well you tell your story are most important when
 trying to convince investors to write that check. Investors are
 looking for compelling founders who have a believable dream and as
 much evidence as possible documenting the reality of that dream. Find
 a style that works for you, and then work as hard as necessary to get
 the pitch perfect. Pitching is difficult and often unnatural for
 founders, especially technical founders who are more comfortable in
 front of a screen than a crowd. But anyone will improve with practice,
 and there is no substitute for an extraordinary amount of practice.
 Incidentally, this is true whether you are preparing for a demo day or
 an investor meeting.

 During your meeting, try to strike a balance between confidence and
 humility. Never cross over into arrogance, avoid defensiveness, but
 also don't be a pushover. Be open to intelligent counterpoints, but
 stand up for what you believe and whether or not you persuade the
 investor just then, you'll have made a good impression and will
 probably get another shot.

 Lastly, make sure you don't leave an investor meeting without an
 attempted close or at very minimum absolute clarity on next steps. Do
 not just walk out leaving things ambiguous.

 **Negotiating and Closing the Deal**

 A seed investment can usually be closed rapidly. As noted above, it is
 an advantage to use standard documents with consistent terms, such as
 YC's safe. Negotiation, and often there is none at all, can then
 proceed on one or two variables, such as the valuation/cap and
 possibly a discount.

 Deals have momentum and there is no recipe towards building momentum
 behind your deal other than by telling a great story, persistence, and
 legwork. You may have to meet with dozens of investors before you get
 that close. But to get started you just need to
 convince [5](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e5)one
 of them. Once the first money is in, each subsequent close will get
 faster and
 easier [6](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e6).

 Once an investor says that they are in, you are almost done. This is
 where you should rapidly close using a handshake
 protocol [19](https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e19).
 If you fail at negotiating from this point on, it is probably your
 fault.

 **Negotiations**

 When you enter into a negotiation with a VC or an angel, remember that
 they are usually more experienced at it than you are, so it is almost
 always better not to try to negotiate in real-time. Take requests away
 with you, and get help from YC or Imagine K12 partners, advisors, or
 legal counsel. But also remember that although certain requested terms
 can be egregious, the majority of things credible VCs and angels will
 ask for tend to be reasonable. Do not hesitate to ask them to explain
 precisely what they are asking for and why. If the negotiation is
 around valuation (or cap) there are, naturally, plenty of
 considerations, e.g. other deals you have already closed. However, it
 is important to remember that the valuation you choose at this early
 round will seldom matter to the success or failure of the company. Get
 the best deal you can get--but get the deal! Finally, once you get to
 yes, don't wait around. Get the investor's signature and cash as soon
 as possible. One reason safes are popular is because the closing
 mechanics are as simple as signing a document and then transferring
 funds. Once an investor has decided to invest, it should take no
 longer than a few minutes to exchange signed documents online (for
 example
 via [Clerky](https://www.clerky.com/) or [Ironclad](https://ironclad.ai/))
 and execute a wire or send a check.

 **Documents You Need**

 Do not spend too much time developing diligence documents for a seed
 round. If an investor is asking for too much due diligence or
 financials, they are almost certainly someone to avoid. You will
 probably want an executive summary and a slide deck you can walk
 investors through and, potentially, leave behind so VCs can show to
 other partners.

 The executive summary should be one or two pages (one is better) and
 should include vision, product, team (location, contact info),
 traction, market size, and minimum financials (revenue, if any, and
 fundraising prior and current).

 Generally make sure the slide deck is a coherent leave-behind.
 Graphics, charts, screenshots are more powerful than lots of words.
 Consider it a framework around which you will hang a more detailed
 version of your story. There is no fixed format or order, but the
 following parts are usually present. Create the pitch that matches
 you, how you present, and how you want to represent your company. Also
 note that like the executive summary, there are lots of similar
 templates online if you don't like this one.

1. **Your company / Logo / Tag Line**

2. **Your Vision** -- Your most expansive take on why your new company
exists.

3. **The Problem** -- What are you solving for the customer--where is
their pain?

4. **The Customer** -- Who are they and perhaps how will you reach them?

5. **The Solution** -- What you have created and why now is the right
time.

6. **The (huge) Market you are addressing** -- Total Available Market
(TAM) \\$1B if possible. Include the most persuasive evidence you have
that this is real.

7. **Market Landscape** -- including competition, macro trends, etc. Is
there any insight you have that others do not?

8. **Current Traction** -- list key stats / plans for scaling and future
customer acquisition.

9. **Business model** -- how users translate to revenue. Actuals, plans,
hopes.

10. **Team** -- who you are, where you come from and why you have what
it takes to succeed. Pics and bios okay. Specify roles.

11. **Summary** -- 3-5 key takeaways (market size, key product insight,
traction)

12. **Fundraising** -- Include what you have already raised and what you
are planning to raise now. Any financial projections may go here as
well. You can optionally include a summary product roadmap (6 quarters
max) indicating what an investment buys.

**Next**

It is worth pointing out that startup investing is rapidly evolving and
it is likely that certain elements of this guide will at some point
become obsolete, so make sure to check for updates or future posts.
There is now an extraordinary amount of information available on raising
venture money. Several sources are referenced and more are listed at the
end of this document.

Fundraising is a necessary, and sometimes painful task most startups
must periodically endure. A founder's goal should always be to raise as
quickly as possible and this guide will hopefully help founders
successfully raise their first round of venture financing. Often that
will seem like a nearly impossible task and when it is complete, it will
feel as though you have climbed a very steep mountain. But you have been
distracted by the brutality of fundraising and once you turn your
attention back to the future you will realize it was only a small
foothill on the real climb in front of you. It is time to get back to
work building your company.

**Appendix**

**Fundraising Rules to Follow**

-   Get fundraising over as soon as possible, and get back to building
     your product and company, but also...

-   Don't stop raising money too soon. If fundraising is difficult, keep
     fighting and stay alive.

-   When raising, be "greedy": breadth-first search weighted by expected
     value [2](http://www.themacro.com/articles/2016/01/how-to-raise-a-seed-round/#e2).
     This means talk to as many people as you can, prioritizing the
     ones that are likely to close.

-   Once someone says yes, don't delay. Get docs signed and the money in
     the bank as soon as possible.

-   Always hustle for leads. If you are the hottest deal of the hour,
     that's great, but everyone else needs to work like crazy to get
     angels and other venture investors interested.

-   Never screw anyone over. Hold yourself and others on your team to
     the highest ethical standards. The Valley is a very small place,
     and a bad reputation is difficult to repair. Play it straight and
     you will never regret it. You'll feel better for it, too.

-   Investors have a lot of different ways to say no. The hardest thing
     for an entrepreneur is understanding when they are being turned
     down and being okay with it. PG likes to say, "If the soda is
     empty, stop making that awful sucking sound with the straw." But
     remember that they might be a "yes" another time, so part on the
     best possible terms.

-   Develop a style that fits you and your company.

-   Stay organized. Co-founders should split tasks where possible. If
     necessary, use software like Asana to keep track of deals.

-   Have a thick skin but strike the right balance between confidence
     and humility. And never be arrogant.

**What Not to Do While Communicating with Investors**

**DON'T:**

-   Be dishonest in any way

-   Be arrogant or unfriendly

-   Be overly aggressive

-   Seem indecisive -- although it is okay to say you don't know yet.

-   Talk so much they cannot get a word in edgewise

-   Be slow to follow-up or close a deal

-   Break an agreement, verbal or written

-   Create detailed financials

-   Use ridiculous / silly market size numbers without
     clear justification

-   Claim you know something that you don't or be afraid to say you
     don't know

-   Spend time on the obvious

-   Get caught up in unimportant minutiae -- don't let the meeting get
     away from you

-   Ask for an NDA

-   Try to play investors off each other when you are not a
     fundraising ninja

-   Try to negotiate in real-time

-   Over-optimize your valuation or worry too much about dilution

-   Take a "No" personally
