# A Conversation with Andy Bromberg - Moderated by Geoff Ralston

Geoff Ralston: Today is Thursday, which usually means that Adora or myself sit up here with someone  notable and have a hopefully interesting conversation.

The someone notable we have today is Andy  Bromberg, my friend and the president of CoinList, the president and co-founder of CoinList, which  is this really fascinating company that is doing some interesting things we'll talk about. But  Andy, maybe we can start by you talking a little bit about your entrepreneurial background,  because interestingly, even though you graduated from Stanford a couple years ago, CoinList isn't your  first venture, is it?

Andy Bromberg: No, that's right. So first of all, thank you for having me, and thank you,  everyone, for coming.

This is going to be a lot of fun.

The entrepreneurial background  for me started even before school in high school.

I was one of those people  that started some web design and marketing businesses. Nothing really notable, but I think it  was really valuable to get that initial experience of building something and hiring a team  and managing a team and firing people and figuring out how to do all of

Geoff Ralston: Did you do all those things while you were in high school?

Andy Bromberg: I did, yeah.

I got started.

It was a lot of fun doing that.

Geoff Ralston: What made you do that? What was it about being an entrepreneur that attracted you  while you were still in high school? God, in high school, I was worried about  other things.

Andy Bromberg: It was really nothing about being an entrepreneur and more about not wanting to do  other jobs that I was able to do when I was in high school. You  can sit there and you can do whatever, serve pizza or scoop ice cream or  whatever it is-

Geoff Ralston: I worked in a supermarket.

It was awesome.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

I did the scooping ice cream, too. Yeah, it was fun, but I was  looking at it and saying, "All these businesses in my town have awful websites, and  I've got a bunch of friends that do this stuff in their spare time, and  that seems like just a way better way to make a little bit of money  while I'm in high school than serving pizza." So I went and did that and  expanded out into videos, marketing photos, all that stuff. Ran a few websites that did  pretty well. But it was really less of, "I want to be an entrepreneur," and  more of, "I really don't want to do these other jobs." And it then developed  into a love for building things from the ground up and trying to create, but  at the time it was purely an alternative, not a primary.

Geoff Ralston: So you really weren't thinking of this as like, "I'm an entrepreneur and I'm going  to ..." Like, "My family has been entrepreneurs forever." It was more an escape, an  alternate route from the normal high school, "I'm going to get some maybe not-so-interesting job  and do something more interesting." And probably you made a lot more money doing it,  too.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, absolutely.

And I think ...

And not to fall into some of the immediate  startup cliches, but I was doing stuff that I really enjoyed doing.

I was hanging  out with my friends and building things, which was really fun.

I enjoyed that. We  built a bunch of websites around just things that we'd liked, and it wasn't necessarily  that we're looking at it and saying, "I'm going to analyze this opportunity and do  my TAM calculation and figure out this and the business strategy." We just said, "I  love playing soccer. What if I made a web site that reviewed soccer cleats?" We're  like, "All right, let's do that," and we made one of those.

It did really  well. "I like messing around with computers. Let's build one around how to dig into  the internals of a Mac and do things with it. Let's build that." That did  pretty well.

And it was really based on these things that we just enjoyed doing,  we had figured out how to do, and wanted to build these sites around our  passions.

Geoff Ralston: I'm intrigued. So this was going pretty well. You're probably a senior in high school.  You get into a little school on the West Coast. Did you ever have the  thought like, "I'm not going to Stanford.

I am going to just ...

I'm going  to ..." Like, "I am the next," whatever, "Mark Zuckerberg.

I'm going"?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, I think those really, truly would have been delusions of grandeur at that point.  These were little things.

They were fun and they made money and I covered my  expenses and was able to do what I wanted to do, but none of these  were going to be massive businesses.

And sure, of course the thought occurs. You're like,  Yeah, I could just keep doing this.

I'm surviving on this.

This would be fun.  But ultimately, I got a great opportunity to go to a great school and decided  to do that, and continued to do them for a little while while I was  there and did some of that stuff, but trailed off during the couple years I  was there and then eventually tailed off completely.

Geoff Ralston: But the idea of starting companies didn't, because apparently the bug hit you again while  you were at Stanford, right?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, that's right. So I was there for a couple years, had a lot of  fun. Really, actually, the most impactful bit there was tied into this whole entrepreneurship thing,  which is I took this amazing class when I was there called Startup Engineering from  a guy named Balaji Srinivasan, who's now the CTO of CoinBase and formerly the CEO  of Earn.com and formerly a partner at Andreessen Horowitz and founder of Counsyl.

Amazing guy  who actually lectured at the very first ever Startup School.

And he taught this class  about ...

I think a lot of times, university classes around entrepreneurship don't teach you  the real skills you need to start a business.

They might teach you some really  high level things or really basic fundamentals, but nothing around the pragmatic steps.

And he  set out to build a class much like this one that said, "No, if you're  actually going to do this, what do you need to do?" There was a lot  of time with guest lecturers coming into the class.

There was a lot of time  with ...

Things like it was a computer science class. How do you deploy code?  How do you do revision control on code and how do you put it on  GitHub and how do you do these different things? The practical pieces.

And we took  this class, a bunch of us, and had an amazing time, and actually out of  that, which we'll come full circle back to this, a small set of folks that  were in this class ended up founding the Stanford Bitcoin Group back in 2012, 2013.

Geoff Ralston: I hope they bought some bitcoin.

Andy Bromberg: Not enough. Never enough. But yeah. So he convinced us all, "This bitcoin thing is  going to be real." At the time, we're looking at him and saying, "No way,  man." I mean, this is 2012. We're like, "Internet is magic Internet money.

I don't  believe you for a second.

This doesn't work." And he said, "Come on. Let's do  it." And so we started the Stanford Bitcoin Group and spent a couple years in  school doing a lot of awesome research and evangelism and had a lot of fun  running around teaching people about crypto and building things and researching things. But then, yeah,  ultimately, I did end up leaving to start a different company and left even that  behind.

Geoff Ralston: Well, so that different company was Sidewire, which interestingly seems like it's more relevant today,  maybe more than bitcoin, because it was all about real news, right?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So I built this platform called Sidewire.

And I left school in 2014 to  start this company.

And I left early because I found what I think is the  perfect partner for it, my co-founder, Tucker, who had a background in politics and I  had this background in computer science and building things, and we came together to build  this project that was a platform where the experts in politics could chat publicly about  the news of the day and everyone else could read and engage but not participate  on that same level. We wanted to build Twitter without the news. What if you  took just the experts and put them in conversation with each other? And we did  this really around the 2016 election.

It was 2014 to we ended up winding it  down last year, 2017, but-

Geoff Ralston: It sounds like we need it really badly.

Andy Bromberg: I think we still do, and I talk to a lot of people that are  building similar products trying to separate out the signal from the noise, and hopefully some  of you in here or online are working to do that, too, because I think  it's such a critical problem.

Turns out, very hard problem for a variety of reasons,  but I think it's critical that someone solved it.

Geoff Ralston: So, maybe for the benefit of these folks, and never fear, we will talk about  crypto, talk a little bit, if you would, about the process of starting the company.  You left school to do it, and the winding down. What happened? And maybe if  there's some lessons learned in there from that experience.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

Absolutely. So the starting was really ...

It always is kind of the best  part when you this germ of an idea and you're trying to turn it into  something.

And so we started ...

Tucker and I met and started talking. We were  introduced by a mutual friend named Adam while I was still in school.

And we  started talking about this concept that there's this crazy noise level in the discourse today,  especially around politics and other topics. Could we separate that out with a lot of  different ideas around how to do it and iterate it through a million different things?  And ultimately, he was working at that time a great job.

I was in school.  We're looking at it, as I'm sure many people are, saying, "This is a big  leap to take to go from very comfortable situations," I had a couple years left  of school, he was, again, doing great at work," to make this leap." And so  we said, "All right." We got to a place where nine months in of casual  discussions, because we were both working and learning, we said, "We think we know what  we want to do here."

Geoff Ralston: And the timing was like-

Andy Bromberg: Timing was great. We're looking at this.

This is right before summer 2014, so we  know we've got some lead time up into the elections to build stuff and then  launch into the election cycle. We thought we knew what we wanted to build.

And  so we said, "All right. Well, we need to get some validation for this before  we get going," which was just the state of mind that we were in.

I  don't think is always true for entrepreneurs by any means, but our state was, "We're  both in great positions.

This is going to be really hard. Let's get some validation."  So we went out and said, "We're going to raise some money, and if we  can successfully raise that money, let's go and do it." And the commitment was that  if we could do that before the summer, I would go obviously over my summer  and work on it full time and then beyond, and he would leave the job  and go and we'd do it together.

And so we were able to put together  that money and get that validation and start building.

Geoff Ralston: Did you raise from angels then?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, almost entirely from angels, yeah.

And we had an amazing set of investors. Lesson  learned, and thankfully we didn't learn it the negative way, having great investors is such  a boon throughout the business when things were going well and when things were going  poorly. We'll get to the wind down. But even that part, having an amazing set  of investors that were aligned with us, cared about us as people, and were supportive  of what we were doing was so critical at that point, and really digging in  on what their motivations were was really important. So we raised from a lot of  people. We had, I forget the exact number now, but something like 44 investors in  our seed round or something like that.

And-

Geoff Ralston: Did you ever think that maybe that was too many?

Andy Bromberg: Yes and no.

The only time I ever genuinely thought that was-

Geoff Ralston: Because you never really want to turn down money, right?

Andy Bromberg: Too many ... Yeah.

The only time I genuinely thought that was too money was  when I was dealing with needing all of them to sign things. But generally, again,  it goes back to the quality of the investors.

They were supportive and not annoying  and never nagged us.

And we sent our monthly updates and made sure they were  informed and it was never a problem.

It was just sending out 44 DocuSigns is  a lot of DocuSigns to send out. But outside of that, it was fun.

Geoff Ralston: You can imagine one issue with 40 or 50 or 60 investors is that even  if you really try to only get high quality investors, the probability that one or  two of those are difficult gets pretty high.

Andy Bromberg: Absolutely.

And of course, even within that set of 44, there was a spectrum of  people ranging from absolutely perfect to slightly less perfect. But on the whole, it was  a really great set, and we were fortunate to be supported by them.

And so  we ended up doing that.

And the short story on the company is we built  for about a year, and then we raised the last part of that round.

It  was all one big round. But we raised the last part of that round from  Smart Capital, who were amazing investors. Highly recommend working with them.

And they completed our  institutional seed round.

And then, we launched the product and ran it for a couple  years and ultimately wound it down last summer, yeah, 2017, mid-2017 I think. From a  product perspective-

Geoff Ralston: Just before you get there, so you went all the way through the 2016 presidential  cycle. Did you guys have any insight more than the rest of us about what  was going to happen in November 2016 based on the expert discussions that were taking  place?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

There's things I can say and things I can't say, but yeah. We were  talking to a lot of smart people-

Geoff Ralston: Say the things you can say.

Andy Bromberg: That's a good one. Yeah.

There's a lot of-
Speaker 3: That's exactly what happened.

Andy Bromberg: That was exactly what happened.

There's a-
Speaker 3: Unexpected result.

Andy Bromberg: There's a lot of smart people out there, and this ties into what Sidewire was  able to do but also who we were talking to, we got this amazing set  of experts on the platform engaging like crazy, about 1,000 people, senators, presidential candidates, reporters,  analysts, staffers, all the people you would want to have talking, the really smart voices,  the smart commentators, having these amazing discussions, going back and forth, firing back and forth,  being entertaining.

And we felt like that side, because it was a marketplace, you had  supply of content and demand of content, no one was paying, but supply and demand,  we crushed the supply, and just, no matter what we did, we couldn't get people  to pay attention to it, which we thought was so interesting. So our thesis going  in, and I think a lot of times startups are about having a thesis and  testing it, but a thesis we felt really strongly about, it wasn't so far as  build it and they will come, but we thought, "This is a marketplace, a two  sided marketplace.

If we can get the supply, if we can get smart people to  have smart conversations about the news of the day, then we will be able to  get people that show up to stick around and keep engaging with those conversations and  reading them." No matter what we did, and there's no way to know what the  issue was, we could not get people to come and stick around. People would show  up and read one conversation and then would not come back.

And I think at  the end of the day what we felt like was in that space people, it's  hard to get people to care about the smart conversations. People say that's what they're  looking for and it might not actually be what drives them and what they actually  want.

Geoff Ralston: They want 140 or 280 characters of sensational tweets.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, yeah.

And I hope that that's not true and I hope that we had  issues with the product that were deeper than that or something like that that caused  it to not be effective in retaining users, but at the end of the day,  we had a really tough time even given a stream of crazy high quality content  from the best people in the world on these topics, tough to get those people  to stick around.

Geoff Ralston: Okay. So this is a tough question for any startup to answer, which is, at  some point you decided it wasn't an issue of tweaks.

It wasn't an issue of  being able to find product-market fit. You could pivot 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 180 degrees,  it wasn't going to happen.

And you wound the company down. How did you guys  come to that decision.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So we did try a couple other related but more than 10 or 20  degree tweaks but related topics, a subscription service that we tried for a little bit  and pitched some enterprise-related things. Ultimately, we decided that what were looking at, the possibilities  we were looking at, even if they succeeded, couldn't be venture-scale businesses that we needed  to be betting on.

And these are conversation that we had with our investors, super  honest, transparent conversations with them, with our team, with each other.

And we said, "All  right. Well, the business, our core business that we've envisioned and been working on for  two, three years, don't think that one is going to work, at least without some  crazy change in how people are thinking or us having some insane insight of fixing  something that's terribly broken.

These other businesses we're looking at, other business lines, there's a  possibility, but these aren't the type of returns that we're looking for or our investors  were looking for when we started this business." And so at that point, we said,  "All right.

Instead of trying to keep this thing on life support, let's wind it  down and move to our next thing and keep building from there." And it was  a decision that everyone was incredibly supportive of.

Again, this goes right back to the  good investor thing.

It is easy for people to give you a lot of grief  when you make a decision like that, but we were incredibly fortunate to have an  amazing set of investors that supported us in that.

Geoff Ralston: Okay. Last question on Sidewire. Do you think if you could've persuaded President Trump to  call you fake news you might have been able to survive?

Andy Bromberg: We've talked about that a lot.

I don't think so.

It's so bizarre, and we  could talk for hours about this, but people would show up and engage, and then  they'd just disappear.

They'd be like, "This just doesn't ...

It doesn't do it for  me." And we talked to people and they'd say, "Yeah, oh, it's great.

The content  is really good.

I just, I would never go and read a ton there, really  pick it up." There's not a lot of people out there that pick up The  New York Times every day and read it cover to cover.

And that's effectively the  same type of person that we were looking for, someone that cared about that level  of discourse.

Geoff Ralston: You have to somehow make it a habit.

This is true for any startup. You  have to somehow create enough value so that you get integrated into people's lives.

And  it's hard to do that with news.

Andy Bromberg: And I do think you allude to people want 140 or 280 characters or crazy  stuff. Sure.

There's an element of that that is people want the crazy things that  just spew up fake news this, fake news that, whatever it is, but the other  piece of that is that it's easiest to create a habit with something that's bite-sized.  And what we were asking people to do was read a real conversation.

It was  kind of like an iMessage format, like people were going back and forth and having  these back and forth conversations.

That's not bite-size.

It takes you a few minutes to  read if not longer to read these really engaging ones.

And they're smart people saying  smart things. You got to think about what they're saying.

And jumping from not engaging  with a service to engaging with a long conversation you have to read is a  big jump to make.

And so I think, yeah, to your point, building habits is  so crucial, and habits are easiest started with something very small that might eventually expand  to something big.

And think about how much time many people spend on Facebook. But  it often starts with something really small there to build that habit. Facebook has great  things around when you sign up, it's connect with 10 friends.

They've got these numbers  of you need to do this, you need to do that.

It's all easy.

It's  all limited time.

And then, the habit starts getting ingrained and you can build it  out bigger from there.

Geoff Ralston: Okay. So let's transition to talk about Andy Bromberg Phase 2.5 where you went back  a little bit to, I won't say your crypto roots, but back to some of  the work you'd been doing earlier at Stanford and got involved with, I guess, Naval  and AngelList and then eventually CoinList. How did that transpire?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So even to take a step further back than that, when I left school  in 2014, I was crazy interested in crypto.

I was spending a ton of time  on it with the Stanford Bitcoin Group and my friends and people in the industry.  And the reason I didn't feel comfortable doing anything in crypt at that time was  because of a secular issue for me, which was at that point in 2014, I  couldn't make a decision.

I thought it was a coin flip whether or not there  was going to be one cryptocurrency forever, if bitcoin was going to be it and  that was going to be the end of it, or if there were going to  be a ton of cryptocurrencies out there.

And I was looking at it and saying,  "Startups, high failure rate already. Do I want to add a 50 percent coin flip  to that?" Because anything I could think of betting on relied on one of those  two outcomes.

And I said, "I don't want to add 50 percent more to an  already attrition rate, so I'm going to not do this for now." By the time  I came back end of last or middle of last year-

Geoff Ralston: The good news, the attrition rate is so high that 50 percent hardly makes a  difference.

Andy Bromberg: That's another way to look at it, but yeah. Double your chance of failure is  not-

Geoff Ralston: It's hard.

Andy Bromberg: A thing I want to take often. Yeah.

And so 2017, I'm looking at it  and saying, "I'm now a believer.

There's going to be at least more than one,  who knows how many successful cryptocurrencies in the long run." We can talk more about  what that number might be and how we should think about that. But I feel  comfortable going back into the space now.

And the story with CoinList is that CoinList  was started about a year ago, just over a year ago. We just celebrated our  internal one year anniversary.

And it was created as a collaboration between Protocol Labs, proud  Y Combinator company, and AngelList to run Protocol Labs' token sale for their product Filecoin,  for their token Filecoin.

Geoff Ralston: And I think you have to unpack that a little bit, because I started to  think about how ... Hopefully a lot of the people here and out there understand  cryptocurrencies, and there's lots and lots and lots and lots that's been written and said  about them, but maybe we can very briefly outline what a cryptocurrency is, what a  token sale is, what a token is, and why you might be selling them.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. Yeah.

Three more hours, everyone?

Geoff Ralston: That's a bunch, yeah.

Andy Bromberg: So I think at its core ... Yeah. Exactly.

At its core, a token is  a scarce digital asset, we'll talk more about what each of these things mean, a  scarce digital asset that represents ownership most commonly of a token network. So the idea  here is that when you launch a token network, it goes out an no one  then controls it. So bitcoin, as a lot of you know, was created by the  pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

I don't know if that's a a he or a she or  a single person or a group of people. No one knows who Satoshi is.

And  somehow-

Geoff Ralston: Which is weird, right? Like this really important thing that's made and lost fortunes for  people and maybe will be the basis if the future economy, no one knows where  it came from. Weird, right?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. Like really let that settle.

It's worth like $100 billion right now, the total  market cap of bitcoin, and no one knows who made it.

And in fact, Satoshi  has some large number of tokens socked away in a wallet somewhere that has never  been used. We have billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. We have no idea who  has that, literally no idea.

Geoff Ralston: If anyone has it.

Andy Bromberg: If anyone. Right.

And so that is the ultimate ideal, how to think about it,  that that's possible. You can launch this token network and have it go out into  the world and have nobody control it and it just happens.

And so what these  companies are now doing when they launch these new tokens, like Protocol Labs launching Filecoin,  their intention is to build a network. Got a lot of code to write.

They've  got to build this thing.

And they're going to put it out there into the  world.

And they're, of course, going to continue to support it as core developers of  the product and improve the network, but they won't actually have control over it.

The  users, whoever those users may be and whatever categories they may fit into for that  specific network, are the ones that have control over that.

Geoff Ralston: We'll talk about what Protocol Labs was doing, because the token is, that Protocol Labs,  it's the first token that CoinList was working on was not ... You could say  bitcoin is of value in of itself.

It's like a new currency. But the token  for Protocol Labs was inextricably linked to a different value that was being delivered to  consumers, right?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, yeah. We should talk about that. One other thing I want to mention just  on tokens in general, and this analogy is a little bit abused, but there's one  reason I'd use it.

I would think of tokens and blockchain technology which powers many  tokens like the Internet for one really core reason.

If I asked you, "Hey, Geoff,  I've got a website, and here's a bunch of data about it. How do you  value it?" it's impossible to answer that question because if that website is NYTimes.com or  Amazon.com or Google.com or Facebook.com, those are all totally different businesses.

They're all built on  the Internet, but you look at each of their revenues, they've got different multiples. How  do you think about how these businesses are built? Saying, "How do you value a  website?" is kind of a meaningless question. You have to know much more about the  specific use case and how it's built.

And in the same way, I think there's  a lot of discussion, I get the question a ton from people, "Okay. But how  do we value these tokens?" And to me, that's a little bit an impossible question  because tokens are built on different premises and have different applications, and you can break  them down into categories and think about how to value each of those categories in  the same way you could say, "Well, how do we value a social networking website?"  or, "How do we value a news website?" or, "How do we value a CPG  website?" But you have to think about those categories.

And the idea of a token  or blockchain technology is really just this kind of meta concept that allows for other  things to be built on top of it.

And more piece of that analogy would  be I draw similarity between the Internet is infrastructure for exchanging and transacting information.

It  moves information around.

Tokens and token networks are infrastructure for transacting or exchanging value. So  for the first time, we can actually programmatically exchange value in this core way.

Geoff Ralston: One of the strange things about the whole conversation ... So here's how I would  answer your question about how to value a website.

And it actually is the way  people have always valued things, which is, well, I would say, tell me about the  cash flows that that website will generate over time? And then, historically, we've figured out  ways to value those things using things like net present value and all these economic  concepts. But tokens seem somehow different because they don't necessarily seem to be tied to  cash flows.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So let's talk about Filecoin, like you were saying, just as an example.

And  this is, again, just one example of many in one of many categories.

I'll give  you kind of a quick description of Filecoin and how it works, and we can  go into it more in the Q&A. So Filecoin is a token that allows for  the exchange of files, storage of files.

It's aiming to solve this problem of, how  do you store files and transact for that and build a market for storing files?  And so if you think about the simplest solution to, "How would one build a  business to solve that problem?" the simplest solution probably looks something like Amazon S3.

If  Geoff has files that he wants to store and I'm saying, "I'm going to start  a business that helps him store these files," I'm probably going to buy a bunch  of servers and Geoff is going to hand me files.

I'm going to put them  on the servers. When he asks for them back, I'm going to hand them back.  And he's going to pay me. So that works. Big businesses today bill like that.  But it has a few problems. So one, you've got someone that's taking fees.

I'm  charging on top of the storage costs for him to be able to do this.  But there's also issues of things like censorship. So I now have access to his  files.

I can censor them.

I can look at them.

I can do whatever I  want to them.

And you're relying on a single third party not to mess anything  up. So I could corrupt the files.

I might have downtime and not be able  to return them.

And so you start to say, "Well, is there a better solution  than this?" And the first version of a better solution I think looks a lot  like the Airbnb of file storage where you'd say, "All right. Well, instead, there's a  whole bunch of people out there who have extra storage space on their computers.

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. Raise your hand if you have extra storage space on your computer?

Andy Bromberg: You're not totally full.

Geoff Ralston: Seriously raise your hand. Come on, all of you. You all have extra space. No?  Your computers are full? Okay.

Andy Bromberg: Let's do it. We're pivoting.

Airbnb for files. So I would say maybe, "All right.  Well, now, Geoff, hand me your files.

I'm going to find someone out here.

I'm  connected to all of you.

I've got software on your computers.

I'm going to put  the files on your computer, and then when Geoff wants them back, I'll ask for  them back.

I'll take them.

I'll give them to him. He'll pay me.

I'll pay  you. [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: Yeah. So these people, the few people who raised their hands, they will rent, like  Airbnb, they'll rent a piece of their storage that they're not using to the network.

Andy Bromberg: So that's a good solution, but it doesn't solve all the problems we talked about.  It does, first of all, make it a little bit cheaper most likely because this  is latent storage space.

It's cheaper than buying new servers. But still, there's a middleman.  There's an intermediary, me, who could go down.

I could have downtime.

I could censor  the files.

Again, I could look at them. So you're still trusting someone. So Filecoin,  Protocol Labs building Filecoin and the underlying thing called IPFS, the Interplanetary File System, which  is the coolest name for a file system ever, said, "Is there a way to  solve this? Can we connect Geoff directly to people out here who have extra storage  space with no trusted intermediary?" That's the problem that Filecoin is trying to solve.

They  build this token for a few reasons. One, Filecoin is used as the mechanism of  payment. So Geoff pays you to store his files with Filecoin. But there's a couple  interesting problems we have to solve. First of all, what if one of you does  something bad? You corrupt his files. You lose them. You don't return them fast enough.  So the first step of the solution is to make each of you that is  storing his files for him already have Filecoin. So if you have extra storage space,  you already have Filecoin. So if you have extra storage space, you already have to  have Filecoin, and you do what's called staking. You take those tokens and you put  them up effectively in escrow.

And you say, "Here.

I'm putting my own tokens up.  I'm putting something at stake.

And if I get caught doing something wrong, if I  don't return his files fast enough, if I don't return them at all, then I  lose my tokens." So you are disincentivized from doing something bad to Geoff's files.

That's  interesting step number one. You run into the second problem, which is, who's the judge  of that? If we're not trusting a central intermediary, how do we know if you  are not storing the files well or corrupting them, or how do we know if  you're not returning them fast enough? And that's where step two of this really interesting  solution comes into play, which is that there's a massive network outside of this room,  thousands of people, of what they call verifiers.

And I'm going to oversimplify what they  do a little bit because they have this crazy thing called proof of space time.  Over the top. We could talk for hours. But a simple solution for how to  make sure that each of you is storing his files correctly is that 1,000 different  people come to Geoff and they each say to Geoff, "Hey, Geoff, what's the 46th  letter of your file? What's the 127th letter of your file? What's the 196th letter  of your file?" Then Geoff says, "It's J, A, and K." Right? And then, they  go to each person that's storing the files and they ask that exact same question.  That person who asked about the 47th letter says, "Hey, what's the 47th letter of  the file you're storing?" You answer that, "J." And they check A, K.

And now,  all of a sudden, when enough verifiers do that, we can say with confidence that  the person storing the files for Geoff is doing so correctly.

And at that point,  the network says, "Great job, everyone." Geoff pays you for storing his files. You get  your staked tokens back. Geoff gets his files if he wants them.

And the verifiers  get rewarded by effectively mining. New tokens are minted by the network and given to  the verifiers for doing that work.

Geoff Ralston: Which makes the supply of coins expand over time.

Andy Bromberg: Exactly.

And so then, you have this market where each of these three parties, the  person with the files, the person with the storage space, and these verifiers are all  incentivized to do the right thing, disincentivized from doing the wrong thing, and there is  no trusted intermediary and you avoid all those problems I cited with the S3 example  at the beginning.

And that really gets to the core of what this all is.  And I'll stop rambling in a second here. But blockchains and tokens are about incentive  alignment.

It's about this question of, how can you build a trustless system, a system  where no party has to trust any other party in a system without anyone being  involved in managing that? And the way to do that is to properly incentivize everyone  and build these economic systems that allow for that interaction to happen.

Geoff Ralston: And I think that's one of the best articulations I've heard of what the blockchain-base  tokens are about, incentive alignment. But they're about one more thing, isn't it? True that  they're also about removing ...

Aligning the incentives of the folks in the network so  that you can remove the central authority, so that you can remove Amazon in the  S2 case or the United States government, the fed, in the bitcoin case, right?

Andy Bromberg: Right.

And that's for any number of reasons.

And that goes back to it could  be for pricing reasons.

It could be that the middleman is charging fees that are  unreasonable.

It could be for censorship reasons.

The middleman is censoring.

It could be for  fear of surveillance.

It could be for any number of reasons. But ultimately, the most  common and effective use of these blockchain systems is to, yes, remove that middleman and  make it so that this trustless system can exist just between the counterparties the need  to be involved in a transaction.

Geoff Ralston: That's kind of the ultimately democratic version of networking, right?

Andy Bromberg: It's markets for everything, yeah.

Geoff Ralston: So everyone out here in Startup School world might be asking themselves, "Cool, crypto. Cool,  tokens. What does that have to do with me?" What does this have to do  with startups? I've talked a bit about the history of investing, and we've come to  this place where tokens are in fact an important component of how startups raise money  and exist. Maybe you can talk a little bit about this evolution to ICOs, initial  coin offerings, and the role CoinList is playing.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So probably a little bit of an unusual perspective here. CoinList, we run token  sales. We make money when people work with us to run their token sales.

That's  great.

I think today, token sales are a good idea for an incredibly, incredibly, incredibly  small number of companies.

I think of the 27,000, is that right, companies in Startup  School, there may be a few where it's a really good idea for a token  to exist, not all 27,000 today.

There are cases I can make for in the  future it making sense for a broader set, but today, I think it's a very  small number. Just to give you a date point on that. CoinList, we've existed for  about a year. We've publicly worked with five token sales in the last year. We  have had inbound people asking us to work with them more than 2500 token sales.  And that's not a bandwidth issue.

That's not us not being able to service that.  That's us sitting there and saying, "These 2495 tokens, not a good fit for us."  And that's kind of-

Geoff Ralston: That's like one of the largest shoe-phemisms, "Not a good fit for you," meaning maybe  not quite legit?

Andy Bromberg: Maybe ... So there's a largely set we see of scams and spam and frauds  and people that are bad actors or just shouldn't be involved at all.

Geoff Ralston: How much ... Just to riff on that for one sec, how much has been  raised on ICOs in 2018 thus far?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. Estimates vary.

It's a tough industry to study. But probably somewhere around $15 billion.  It's a big number, more than venture capital.

Geoff Ralston: Just to repeat that in case someone maybe didn't hear that clearly, more money has  been raised in ICO than has been delivered in venture capital to companies in 2018  thus far.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

And some people look at that and say, "Wow. What a great sign for  the ICO industry. We are thriving." I look at that and say, "That seems really  concerning to me." Because venture capital has been around for, as we've talked about before,  almost a century of real true development in venture capital, especially for technology companies.

A  pretty well developed industry. We've figured out the norms and how these things need to  be created.

The idea that ICOs have really only existed for four years and really  in their mass form about two years, the idea that we could surpass that so  quickly in that stage of development I see as actually a more concerning thing than  a positive thing for the ICO industry.

Geoff Ralston: One thing it shows is demand, because these are proxies for investing in startups. But  it also, I guess, shows a propensity for people to believe things that maybe they  shouldn't be believing.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, I think that's right.

And it's also just a function of it being a  new industry that it's brand new.

It's really hard to diligence for these investors.

There  aren't norms.

There's no data points right now on what tokens are successful and which  ones aren't we're so early into the industry.

And that's ...

It's not because everything  has failed.

It's because it's just too early to know.

And so investors don't have  a good sense for how to do diligence.

I think about the process-

Geoff Ralston: Even understanding what they represent, because at least if you're buying a penny stock, you  still know that that penny stock represents a claim on the future cash flows of  that company in one way or another.

Admittedly, that is a theoretical thing, but at  least it's grounded in something concrete.

A lot of times, these ICOs aren't grounded in  anything.

Andy Bromberg: But I also ...

I don't think it has to necessarily be quantitative.

I think  about the YC process for admitting companies and all the data you guys have on  years of startups and what succeeds and what doesn't and what are positive signals and  what aren't and how you look through those applications. You just can't do that in  tokens right no.

There's no training data to look at.

And so that's resulted in  this we've got to be overly aggressive mentality from investors of, "Let's get in. Let's  get in.

These things are going to make us rich." And that's, I think, pumped  up the amount of money that has gone into the space past where it really  reasonably should be.

And it may be that that's an important step in the industry's  development, that you need this kind of huge infusion of capital to give the winners  enough money to start to win, and then you can sort out how to diligence  it better going forward, but certainly, the vast majority of that money that has gone  into ICOs is going into ICOs that are not going to be successful.

Geoff Ralston: So just for the edification of everyone here, could you just step back and say,  what's an ICO? So what are these token things? What does CoinList ... Why would  you use CoinList? Why can't you just do it? And then, maybe we can transition  to answer the question, you started to talk about, who should think about doing an  ICO and who shouldn't?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

And just on terminology for folks that are newer to this space, I tend  to use tokens, coins, cryptocurrencies all synonymously, crypto assets even. Some people have slightly different  definitions.

I tend to use them all the same.

And then, ICO, token sale, kind  of the same thing in my eyes. So those are generally synonymous.

An ICO or  a token sale is, ICO, initial coin offering, is when a new network is being  created and a company is issuing tokens for the first time and this network is  starting to distribute them.

And they run this token sale to do two things generally.  One, to raise money for the future development of that network and support that network  in the long term, and two, to get early distribution of those tokens, because these  networks like Filecoin only works if there are people who have it to store files,  people who have it to give files to be stored, and incentive alignment around that.  And so you need a way to distribute these tokens initially. One way to do  so is to sell them.

And so they go out and conduct these sales where  they go and sell tokens to investors or to use users that want to eventually  participate on the network or [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: Right.

And that's a case where the network literally does not work unless you have  a token.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah.

That's exactly right.

And so Filecoin was the first token sale that we supported  at CoinList.

They raised a staggering $205 million in their initial coin offering.

And we've  worked on a number of other ones since, Blockstack and PROPS and Origin and TrustToken.  And what CoinList does is for that small set of companies we support the logistics  of the token sale. So there's a bunch of compliance work you need to do,  which is probably not worth getting into, but you'll hear these buzzwords: Know your customer,  KYC, anti-money laundering-

Geoff Ralston: You need lawyers to be involved.

Andy Bromberg: And we have many of them.

And so we handle the compliance. We handle the  transactions, how the payments work and money comes in.

And we handle the-

Geoff Ralston: You have to know how this going to work with the SEC, because they're going  to be-

Andy Bromberg: Totally. [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: Already are intimately involved, right?

Andy Bromberg: Lots of open regulatory questions. Lots of closed regulatory questions that you need to know  how to be able to answer correctly.

And we support these companies through that process.  And then, we'll market some of these deals publicly or offer them to the investors  on our platform to be able to invest in. We also offer other services, like  that just compliance piece without the marketing as much we do for a broader set  of token issuers. We have this whole other Airdrops product to give tokens away to  users. So you'll start hearing this buzzword Airdrops more and more I think.

This is  a way of giving ... So we talked about ICOs being a way to fundraise  and to distribute tokens to users. Sometimes, you might not need to do the fundraising  part and you might just want to distribute tokens to a wide set of users.  How do you do that? Giveaway.

And the first example of an air drop I  would argue, or one of the first, was PayPal when they got started and you'd  sign up for PayPal, you'd get 10 bucks of PayPal credits.

It wasn't a token  obviously. But they were saying, "We've got a network. We need people to use this  network. We just need to give them a little bit of money to get started.  They can send some money. You send it to a friend, pay for something.

And  then, they're going to get really addicted and start to put more money in.

And  that's what an Airdrop is.

It's a way of saying-

Geoff Ralston: And it worked.

Andy Bromberg: It totally worked.

Geoff Ralston: It worked.

Totally worked.

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. You could give tokens away to people, they can start to use them on  the network, and then, hopefully, they become such a fan of that network that they  put more of their own capital in to use it.

Geoff Ralston: So, who amongst Startup School world should think about tokens as a way to kickstart  their network, to raise funds potentially, and who shouldn't?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So today, and this is again where I differentiate between today and tomorrow or  the future, today I think the most valuable applications of this technology are applications where  you have parties that are not willing to trust each other, that aren't willing to  trust each other, that aren't willing to trust a central intermediary either, and you need  to build this trustless system.

This does not describe a lot of businesses. But if  you-

Geoff Ralston: Where trust is somehow fundamental to the functioning of whatever product you're creating.

Andy Bromberg: Exactly. So if we look at an example that I would say is not a  great candidate for a token, there's possibilities but not a great candidate, would be Airbnb.  So on its face, you would say, "This actually sounds pretty good.

I want to  stay somewhere. Someone out there I've never met before has a home that I can  stay in.

I don't trust that person.

I've never met them before.

I've got no  connection to them. But I do trust Airbnb." So you can have this intermediary.

I  have no problem trusting Airbnb.

I stay in them all the time.

And I say,  "All right.

If Airbnb has vetted them and they're backing me up, they've got their  insurance thing, they've got all this, no problem.

I trust Airbnb. Let's do it." That  means not a great candidate for a token. But if you start to have systems  where you don't trust even the intermediary much less the person on the other side,  that's where a token might be a good fit.

And the reason I'm not giving  you-

Geoff Ralston: The Russian version of Airbnb maybe.

Andy Bromberg: Right.

Geoff Ralston: Maybe you'd want a coin for that.

Andy Bromberg: Totally possible. Yeah.

Absolutely.

And trust in institutions is fading.

There's all sorts of research  on this. Edelman puts out a great survey on trust every year.

And so there  is an idea that this could be more of a thing in the future. But  the reason I'm not answering your question with just a slew of examples I can  give you of like if your business fits this, do a token, if your business,  is because I just do not think there are that many today.

And so it's  more about finding these very specific use cases where it's particularly valuable to have a  token than to try and fit into a category that could have a ton of  tokens coming out of it.

Geoff Ralston: I want to save some times for questions, but just before we move on, you've  talked in the past about pros and cons of tokens versus, say, convertibles of various  kinds, like YC's SAFE, that probably most startups use to raise money now, both from  the perspective of a startup company and from an investor. Maybe could we talk a  little bit about those?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So everyone in here, especially if you're in this class, has done a lot  of thinking about traditional financing and things like-

Geoff Ralston: Or you will if you haven't.

Andy Bromberg: Yes.

Absolutely. Keep an eye out for those lectures.

Things like investor protections. What rights  do investors get? How do you have to deal with them? How do you fundraise  from them? You sit down and talk to them. You follow up. You do a  call.

There's all these things that go into a traditional fundraiser, things we think about.  With tokens, a lot of that is flipped on its head. So probably the biggest  difference is that when you buy into a token, and this goes back to our  original discussion of what a token is, the company does not control the network in  this ideal form.

They release this network and it goes out into the wild, and  you own tokens on that network. You own part of that network. But that means  you have no formal relationship to the company as an investor in these tokens.

And  as a company, technically, you have no formal relation to the investor that owns your  tokens.

And so there's this idea right now in startups of we talked good and  bad investors, like they may call you, they may check in, you've got an obligation  to update them, you've got an obligation to get them to sign documents at certain  times when transactions happen. When people buy into a token network released by a company,  none of those obligations go.

And there are pros and cons to that certainly on  both sides of the equation. On the startup side, on one hand, way easier.

These  people don't have any stake in your business. You can do whatever you want with  the company itself.

There's no control that they have there.

The downside of that is  they're not necessarily aligned with you. So the upside of equity is that it's upside.  When someone wins with equity, everyone wins with equity, in the general case obviously.

There's  some edge cases. But incentives are aligned, and that's awesome. With tokens, the incentives, the  investors are not necessarily aligned with that of the company. So if the token is  pumping up for some reason and flying up the charts, an investor who invested a  ton of money doesn't have any lock ups on it.

They may just say, "Yeah,  I'm getting out.

I'm up 10x right now.

That seems to totally worth it.

I'm  getting out." And they dump it and hurts the price and it hurts the company  by second order effect there.

And so you get this kind of misalignment. You win  because they don't have any stake in your company but you lose because they don't  have any stake in your company.

And from the investor perspective, the exact flip side  of that, which is on one hand, you're not obligated to the company at all.  You can do whatever you want. You just own tokens on a network they've released.  But the other side of that is that you might not get as much visibility  into what's happening. You might not get those monthly updates. You might not be as  engaged with the founder as you may have never met the founders.

The idea in  startup fundraising of raising for people that you've never met before does not really happen  that much. Occasionally, you see little bit with certain things, but-

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

And you'd usually advise against it.

Andy Bromberg: Usually advise against it.

In token world, many of these sales have had hundreds or  thousands of investors that just signed up on the website. CoinList facilitates this. People come  and invest in sales where they have never met, talked to, chatted with the founders  at all.

Geoff Ralston: You can go to CoinList right now and sign up for token sales.

Andy Bromberg: You certainly can. You can only participate if you're an accredited investor unfortunately. Site regulation  sadly. But yes, you may have no relationship to the founders.

Again, pros and cons  on both sides there.

Geoff Ralston: Yeah.

It's kind of an amazing from an investor perspective, because if you invest in  a startup company, usually before you see any return, it's a lot of time, five,  ten years. But with a token, if the token goes up tomorrow, you can invest  and sell the next day.

Andy Bromberg: Right.

And I do think we are converging.

Tokens, again, are young.

I repeat this  to myself all the time.

They're such a young industry.

They are converging a little  bit more towards venture capital. We're starting to see vesting schedules and lockups for investors  trying to get this incentive alignment a little bit tighter than the freest version that  I was just describing.

And I think a lot of it is going to converge  that way. Early in the ICO market, companies raised once.

They said, "We're going to  raise one monster token sale.

That's going to be it. We'll never need to fundraise  again." More and more, we're seeing people talk about staged things that start to look  a lot more like a traditional seed series A, series B.

And so it's going  to look more like venture capital in the future, I think, but there's still going  to be these key differences of what it is that you're buying and what that  means for the relationships between the people involved.

Geoff Ralston: Awesome. So in the time remaining, if there's any questions on any of the topics  we've talked about ... Okay. Right here in the front row.
Speaker 4: Yes. So [inaudible] I have two questions, one about venture investors. You said good investors.  If you could share with us three big points to look out for good investors.

Geoff Ralston: Okay. Okay. Hang on there. We'll take each one in turn. So what are the  characteristics of good investors in your view?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So I'll talk about a couple characteristics and then a way to find out.  The characteristics that I think are really important for investors is, one, alignment with whatever  your goals are as an entrepreneur. Not everyone's goals in this room are going to  be exactly the same. Some people might be saying, "For me, this is a $10  billion or bust.

That is it.

That is all I'm going for, and I will  always make the decision that leads toward that outcome." Others might say, "Listen.

If I  built a $10 million a year revenue business, I would be super happy, and I'm  looking for investors for that." If investors are not aligned with that goal, you're going  to be in big trouble, because you will eventually make a decision that runs exactly  counter to what they want.

And so you need to make sure they're aligned with  you on that. Second, how you interface with them.

Is the interaction friendly? It can  be intense.

They may do diligence.

There may be some real back and forth and  firing back and forth. But do you walk away feeling good after your interaction with  them? If you do not, that is not a good sign, because you are talking  to them at a time when it's supposed to be really positive. You're talking about  joining forces, a one plus one equals three situation.

If you're walking away and saying,  "This does not feel totally right," that's a really bad sign, because at some point,  in all likelihood, hate to break it to you, things will not go perfectly.

And  I'm not saying the business is going to shut down or anything, but you will  have a tough time at some point.

And if an investor is not great when  things are good or you're talking about possible ways to work together and build something  amazing, they will be really bad when things are going poorly.

And so I'd watch  out for those.

Those are kind of my two biggest things.

The last one is,  people argue about this all the time, but the idea of value add.

I don't  think every investor has to be crazy perfect, they're going to make some amazing difference  in your business. But if they're aligned and you need capital and they believe it's  a good investment, that can be fine. You don't necessarily need someone that's going to  do everything. But when you can find those investors, obviously, that can make that introduction  for you, give you that customer feedback, whatever it may be, recruit someone, that's tremendously  valuable.

The last thing I would say on that is that I think a super  underrated part of fundraising is due diligence and reference checks on investors. So few people  do this, but it is amazing. You talk to an investor. You're getting towards it.  You're saying, "Geoff, I think we've got a great relationship here.

I'm really excited about  working with you.

I think we could do something amazing and I would love to  work with you as one of my investors.

Is it cool? Can I talk to  some people that you've invested in before? I just want to get a sense of  your working style and how we could work together in the future." Now, first of  all, if they say no to that, really bad signal.

Anytime someone says no to  a reference check, bad signal.

They'll probably say yes.

And talk to people that he  sends you. Maybe talk to a couple other people that you know he's invested in  that he didn't send you.

And just ask them those questions, because every founder that's  had an investor can give you a very intuitive gut check on, "Geoff is amazing.  He was actually there darkest days.

Things were tough. He came into the office, helped  us figure out product strategy.

This happened.

That happened." And then, you go back to  him and you say to him, "Geoff, I'm even more excited now because I talked  to a bunch of these people and they said you were so helpful on this,  you were so helpful on that. Let's make this happen," that's the most exciting way  to close an investor conversation, highest chance of closing the money, and you've now set  expectations around what you hope the relationship will be like. So I would definitely do  those calls.

It takes time, but it's worth it for investors you're looking at working  with.

Geoff Ralston: So that was a solid gold answer. So please, please, please pay attention to Andy's  wisdom there. Yes.
Speaker 5: I'm in the blockchain crypto space. So given the nuclear winter that's occurring right now,  is CoinList looking to pivot to support STOs, or are you going to stay on  the ICO half?

Geoff Ralston: Okay. So the question is, given the nuclear winter in crypto land, is CoinList looking  to pivot to STOs, or are you going to stick firmly with ICOs?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So to unpack that a little bit, STO is a security token offering.

And  this goes back to what we were talking about before around the blockchain and token  infrastructure being something that you can build a lot of different things on. One of  those things that people talk about is what's commonly called a security token or an  asset-backed token.

And this is an idea of taking an existing asset, something that exists  in the real world, the traditional world, it may be startup equity, it may be  real estate, it may be gold bars, whatever it may be, and building a token  that represents that asset. So one token equals one percent of this building or this  building's revenue streams, whatever it is.

And the question is, are we looking to support  those where traditionally we supported ICOs of these tokens that are more token networks that  only exist in the network itself and not in the actual, physical world.

Geoff Ralston: I mean, I guess you could do an ICO of an STO.

That's really ...  It's like it's a little-

Andy Bromberg: Totally. So that's right where I'd go on that, is that we are certainly looking  to support offerings of security tokens. We don't see that as a pivot. We actually  see ourselves as just infrastructure to support sales of tokens.

Thus far, they've happened to  be what are commonly called protocol tokens where they're these kind of network tokens and  they function on these networks alone.

If the tokens we're offering are asset-backed instead of  network-backed, that makes no difference to us as the platform. We just have to figure  out if it's a good fit for our investor base and if that can happen.  But ultimately, the process for running those sales is exactly the same.

Geoff Ralston: Awesome. Yeah.
Speaker 6: Are tokens currency?

Andy Bromberg: Are tokens currency? Regulatory answer.

Totally depends. Practical answer, yes and no.

In the colloquial  form of currency where you're using something to exchange for something else, absolutely. Most of  these tokens are some sort of object that fits into that category. Some might not  be. So one example.

I often refer to Bitcoin's value as a store of value.  And that means I'm really looking at bitcoin most analogous to digital gold. Gold is  not a currency. You can use it to exchange for things, but it's not really  great for that.

It's more used to store value. You put value into it. You  take value of it.

And that's how I see the value of Bitcoin.

I don't  think that's the same for every token. More of these tokens fall into that exchange  category. But from a regulatory stance aside from the colloquial definition, the answer largely is  no to that, but in certain cases maybe yes, again, depending on the exact characteristics.  And we can talk about specific examples there.

Geoff Ralston: And Bitcoin is complicated, because there's Bitcoin Cash, which is maybe a currency.

Andy Bromberg: Totally different token. So Bitcoin Cash-

Geoff Ralston: But it's a totally different currency, although ... Yeah. Okay. Maybe that's too much. Yes.
Speaker 7: So I have a question. So if Airbnb started today, do you think it would  be a right candidate for an ICO?

Andy Bromberg: If Airbnb did?
Speaker 7: Yeah, if Airbnb started to-

Geoff Ralston: So if Airbnb started today, would they be a good candidate for an ICO?

Andy Bromberg: I don't think necessarily.

Again, I go back to I trust Airbnb.

I have no  problem with that.

And yes, I'll go forward and rent someone's house through Airbnb and  be happy with that.

There are arguments that it could be successful in that manner  because maybe it's less fees if there's less of a middleman. But Airbnb does provide  valuable services to me as the consumer, and I'm willing to pay for those services.  I don't feel like Airbnb is taking unreasonable fees on those transactions because they provide  a lot of services.

And so do they need a network? I don't think they  need one. Could it be an interesting service? Could it be a potentially competitive service?  Absolutely. But if I were starting that business today and wanted to connect homeowners or  apartment owners to people that wanted to stay there, I would probably go the centralized  route initially, but with an eye on the crypto space and seeing if there might  be opportunities in the future.

The last thing I would say on that is it  is underrated today how hard it is to build these token networks.

It is so  hard.

They're so young.

The tooling is not there. Development is incredibly challenging.

Augur was  really the first ICO that officially launched in a big way.

Three years from their  ICO to launching.

They just launched this summer.

And the amount of work that went  into that is unimaginable.

Geoff Ralston: I mean, you have to replace the human beings at Airbnb who are building the  processes and infrastructure to make it a trusted network.

Andy Bromberg: With no precedent for how to build these things.

And so even that alone, you're  looking at it as a business trying to raise as little money as possible and  push forward with what you have.

It's a tough move.

Geoff Ralston: But do you think it's fair to say that there's a faction of crypto world  that says, "Central authority bad, and we should replace all of those with a trusted  network?"

Andy Bromberg: Absolutely.

And I think a lot of crypto has its roots in this kind of  anarcho-libertarian philosophy that I think was incredibly important for the early days of crypto because  that is one of its core use cases, the avoidance of middlemen, and driving the  industry forward with that philosophy is incredibly important. But that's very different from looking at  it from a really pragmatic business side.

And there may be some crossover there, but  it's not 100 percent.

Geoff Ralston: Right. Over there.
Speaker 8: So maybe this is two questions. But I think said-

Geoff Ralston: One question at a time. Because it's really fun to pile them on, but there's  a lot of people who want to ask questions. So ask the one you really  want answered first.
Speaker 8: Okay. What's the difference between value and information? You mentioned the information is for information  and tokens [inaudible] for value. How do you distinguish the two?

Geoff Ralston: How do you distinguish between value and information?

Andy Bromberg: Yes.

It's a really important question.

I think at its core, you can represent value  in information. So I can make online transactions with the Internet without tokens and move  value around. But what that's really doing is moving symbolic representations of value around and  directing different entities to move it. So when I make a payment with my credit  card on the Internet, sure, it is just information that is moving.

I'm sending authorization  codes. My CVV goes here and this happens. But ultimately what happens is it goes  to one issuing, the credit card-issuing entity, and conveys them the information, "Andy just spent  $10 on this merchant. Please debit $10 or put $10 on Andy's balance.

And then,  merchant, please, here are $10. You have now been paid for your services." What didn't  happen there, the Internet did not actually transmit that value.

Those entities on either side  pushed the value from one to the other.

They may have done it over the  bridge of the Internet, but they were the ones that were maintaining the value. What's  interesting with this token ecosystem is that the value is actually totally contained in the  network.

There are entities that are actually holding that value for you.

There's no credit  card issuer that is keeping an eye on my balance and taking payments from me.  And there's no bank on the other side that is holding onto the merchant's money.  Instead, all the value is represented on the network and people actually own that value.  So I have my own keys on that network.

I own those tokens or I  own the representation of those tokens.

I'm not just owning information that gives me access  to someone else owning that value. So at the end of the day, going to  just a single player example, my bank account, it's my money, but it's not really  my money.

The bank has the money, and I just have information that allows me  to access that money.

In the world of tokens, I actually have ownership of that.  Those are my tokens because I have the keys to access that, and no one  else can do anything with it aside from me who has that access.

And so  when we talk about transmitting value as opposed to transmitting information, it's about direct interactions  between nodes.

I can pay Geoff with tokens and never touches a third party at  all, whereas with information, it requires those third parties where you're informing them to move  money between each other.

Geoff Ralston: Yes.
Speaker 9: Yeah.

I [inaudible] protocol.

It's really hard to upgrade just because it's so decentralized [inaudible]  backwards-compatible things to the protocol, you are essentially creating a split in the network. [inaudible]

Geoff Ralston: So this is, I guess, more of a comment on the rigidity of networks. Once  you put them out there, it's hard to then go and change them and upgrade  them and make them backward compatible to other things. Do you agree with that?

Andy Bromberg: Yes and no.

I think, again, early days, so there hasn't been a lot built  around the upgradability of these networks, and once you put them out there, it's harder  to make those changes, especially breaking changes.

There's more and more infrastructure being built that  supports that.

It's something that I'm not incredibly concerned about in the future.

It's something  that feels inevitable that we'll get to a place where these networks can be easily  upgraded.

At the same time, it goes back to this idea, no company controls that  network.

And so they can't dictatorially make that change.

Ifc they make a change and  the users on the network don't agree with it, the network will do what's called  forking, we could talk for hours about this, where you get two different ones.

And  this is where the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash piece came in.

If Facebook makes a change, I  can't just make a new Facebook that goes back to the old change.

That doesn't  work.

I don't have access to all of Facebook's infrastructure and code.

In the crypto  world, if, say, Protocol Labs made a change to Filecoin that people didn't like, it  would be totally possible for people to start back right before that change happened with  the entire history of transactions with all the code and make a new version of  Filecoin, Filecoin Cash-

Geoff Ralston: And it's out of Protocol Labs' control.

Andy Bromberg: Totally out of their hands. Yeah. So it's about, again, goes back to this incentive  alignment thing that, sure, maybe someone can write to this version of the protocol and  make changes to it, but they have to make sure all the users are aligned  from an incentive perspective to participate on that same network going forward instead of forking  it off.

Geoff Ralston: Or not, because you can fork, and then that fork is then backwards compatible and  the new one isn't or-

Andy Bromberg: Totally.

Geoff Ralston: Vice versa.

And so maybe it's easier because of the ability to fork.

Andy Bromberg: Absolutely. Yeah.

Geoff Ralston: More questions. Over there.
Speaker 10: Going back to [inaudible] is it possible even for people with a network to propose  a change [inaudible] the network [inaudible] that change?

Geoff Ralston: Is it possible for someone who's a node, a person who's part of the network,  to propose a change that then gets incorporate into the network?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah, absolutely. So anyone, node or otherwise, can try to fork a network and create  a new version of it with a change.

There's, again, no special control that these  companies have over these networks other than some sort of moral authority.

If they created  the network, I probably trust them to be the best stewards of that network and  know how to build it.

They're probably the biggest experts on it because they built  them in the first place. So you're going to probably go with their version until  there's a reason not to.

And as soon as there's a reason not to, which  could either be because they do something bad or because someone else proposes something better,  they could be going on a great path and making a great product, but if  someone else, another node, anyone in this room says, "I've got an improvement to Bitcoin.  I think it's going to be better than what the existing core developers are doing.  I'm going to propose that.

I'm going to align people around it and get people's  attention around it," that could fork and be more successful, and it's totally up to  that person to do so.

Geoff Ralston: Let me argue that for a sec.

Andy Bromberg: Please.

Geoff Ralston: Isn't true that to really ...

These decisions become somewhat democratic, and so the network  decides. But isn't it also true that these companies that do ICOs and are the  creator of a token tend to hold a significant portion of the currency for themselves  and therefore have the biggest voice on the network?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So a couple things. One is when I'm answering these kind of high level  questions about crypto, I'm thinking purely of the good one, the very small set of  good tokens.

There are lots of bad actors out there that build in all sorts  of weird ways to influence the network, but just talking about the ideal of these  tokens and blockchain networks, that's where we're going on these questions.

Absolutely some of these  issuers have significant stakes in the network, but a couple things happen. One, the voices  are not always based on who has the biggest stake in the network.

A really  important voice is whoever is mining, and this is a whole nother topic, but what  the consensus mechanism is. So on Bitcoin, the Bitcoin core developers is a group of  people that have access and can try and change the code of Bitcoin, but it  has to be adopted by all the miners, which are these people running huge server  farmers doing work on the Bitcoin network.

If those people choose not to adopt it,  even if the ... You can think of the Bitcoin core developers as being from  the entity that created Bitcoin, which isn't really true in that case because it's again  created by a pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, but the miners have the power there, not the  people that are core developing it.

And so it depends on, again, how the network  makes its decisions.

Geoff Ralston: So it's complicated.

Andy Bromberg: It is complicated.

Geoff Ralston: Okay.

A couple more questions. Right there.
Speaker 11: What developments would you expect to see in the ICO industry before ICOs became a  viable path for more startups?

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. So what developments would I expect to see in the ICO industry before they  become a viable path for more startups? It really depends on, and again, this goes  back to it's a really question, what we mean by ... So when we say  ICO, we're talking about initial coin offering. When we say coin or token, what are  we talking about? And that's where it's so many different things. So what we've really  been talking about here is a history of successful or looking to be successful protocol  tokens, these tokens that are network-based that have this trust avoidance or trustless networks.

I  don't think there's a world where every startup is going to need to do that.  I trust my corner store to give me good food.

I trust my ... So  that will always exist.

And so I don't ever think that every company will need  to a token of that blend. But you can imagine a world, going back to  the STO question, where there are tokens that represent company equity, and I am purchasing  company equity via a token instead of some other document, an equity round or a  SAFE or whatever it may be.

And maybe there's an underlying SAFE below it and  there's a token that represents it. For that to happen, I think what we'll need  to see is just a lot more infrastructure be built out.

There's reasons that that  is a good idea to have these asset-backed tokens, things like increased access to liquidity.  There's all these exchanges being built and liquidity pools for increased liquidity for these asset-backed  tokens.

They're interoperable with each other so you can move them around more easily.

I  think this is a trend Geoff and I have talked about before. Generally, the arc  of venture capital bends towards increased liquidity and speed to liquidity, and these things come  faster and faster.

A little bit of a speed bump in recent years, but generally,  I think moving that way.

And tokens will only continue that trend. So I do  think as infrastructure gets built out it may make sense for companies to raise equity  with tokens that represent that equity.

And that is not some sort of crazy ICO  phenomenon where you'll be able to go out as a seed stage startup and say,  "My token is worth $200 million." No.

It's going to represent the equity.

It'll be  worth what the equity is worth, maybe with some premium for the benefits of tokenization  on top of it. But we need infrastructure there, and until that infrastructure exists, I  don't think it's worthwhile except as maybe a proof of concept for people to show  that it's possible. But we need more built there, and hopefully that gets built in  the coming months or years.

Geoff Ralston: Great. One more question right here.
Speaker 12: [inaudible] Do you think the future is going to be a handful of blockchain, or  many, many hundreds, and why [inaudible]

Andy Bromberg: Yeah. Do I think the future is going to be a handful of blockchains or  hundreds of blockchains? And I think it'll be a relatively small number of blockchains but  a relatively high number of tokens.

And to explain that for just a minute here,  many of these token networks allow for other tokens to be issued on top of  them. So the most common buzzword you'll hear, Ethereum, which is the second biggest cryptocurrency  out there, it's got a blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain.

And they've created standards on top  of Ethereum to issue other tokens on top of Ethereum.

And the one you'll hear  tossed around a lot is an ERC20 token.

This is a token that is issues  on top of the Ethereum blockchain but represents something other than Ethereum and its price  is not necessarily correlated with that of Ethereum.

I don't think there's a need for  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of blockchains to exist because they are a pain to  maintain, you need all these users on it with different mechanisms for how they interact  with each other, but I do think we're going to have a world with a  lot of different tokens. Maybe not as many as some people think.

I'm not kind  of a token for everything. But if we get to this world of asset-backed tokens  where all of a sudden buildings can have tokens that represent their ownership or companies  can have tokens that represent their ownership, that's a lot of tokens that are possible  out there, but they will not all have their own blockchains.

They will likely be  built on something like-

Geoff Ralston: Which would be very error prone if they do, right, because-

Andy Bromberg: Absolutely.

Geoff Ralston: Because it's all new code and there's all sorts of things that can break.

Andy Bromberg: And you need a certain critical mass for it to be safe and secure.

And  so maybe they'll all be on Ethereum or Stellar or one of these other networks.  But lots of tokens. Relatively few blockchains would be my prognostication.

The last point I  would make on that is once again we are less than a decade into crypto  at all. We are less than five years into tokens beyond the very basic building  blocks at all.

That is the earliest, earliest days imaginable of this ecosystem, and any  prediction I make today stands probably a worse chance of being true than a good  one. So who knows? We'll see in the next, in the coming decades.

Geoff Ralston: And that's a great way to end.

Thank you very much for your time, Andy.

Andy Bromberg: Thank you.

Thank you, guys.

That was fun.
