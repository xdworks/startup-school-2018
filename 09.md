# Gustaf Alstromer - How to Get Users and Grow

Geoff Ralston: On company updates. Please be honest. They're for you and not for us.

If you  make them clearly crazy like, "We're never ever launching. We're launching in four million years,"  we'll get the hint. So don't do that. There have been a lot of questions  about the graduation requirement, which was that you had to submit 9 out of 10  weekly updates. This course was originally a 10-week course, and things changed around a little  bit.

It's actually more of a 9-week course now, and so it was a little  bit difficult for some groups to get going because of our little snafu in the  beginning of the course. Here's the deal. Eight out of nine updates is just fine.  But we're also going to extend the class, actually really two weeks beyond the lecture,  so that there will be plenty of time to do 10 updates, if you so  choose, and you choose to do nine out of 10, but eight out of nine  will be the absolute requirement for consideration for the $10,000 grant. We'll be flexible, but  make them good updates, make them real updates. Another reminder. Those weekly updates are due  11:59 p.m. Every Sunday, Pacific Standard Time. There's been some confusion about that, and we've  written it a number of times, but please recall when that is. Questions, again, about  anything, about your moderators, about your groups, about your updates, please send to Startup School  at Ycombinator.com. My very last note is a reminder to launch if you haven't already.  The only way to find out if you've made something that people would really want  is to have people really use it, so get your products out there, if you  haven't. Now, I'm going to introduce our first speaker who is my esteemed partner at  Y Combinator, Gustaf Alströmer, who in 2012 was part of the group that built the  growth team at Airbnb.

If you know anything about Airbnb, you know from 2012 for  the next five years, they grew an enormous amount. This is something that Gustaf knows  better or at least as good as anyone in the entire world, so I'm thrilled  to have him talk today about growth.
Gustaf A.: Thank you very much. Before I begin, thank you so much to Steven, Geoff, Adora,  Bill for putting all this together, so we can be here and do this today.  I'm going to stalk about growth. My background before joining YC last summer was being  one of the first person on the growth team at Airbnb and then growing that  team from, I think we were three people in the beginning. This is how many  people were in 2015. We then grew to 100 and 120 people or something like  that. Almost everything I'm talking about today here, I owe this group.

That's sort of  where I learned all this stuff. Some of the best ways to learn to work  on user growth is to actually work on a growth team.

I was fortunate to  do that for almost five years of it at Airbnb. Before I start, one of  the questions that might be obvious, the answer might be obvious for some people, but  not for everyone, is sort of like why should we do this? Why is growth  important? I'm surprised how often I actually get this question, but it might be worth  thinking about it for a second. When you make your product, some people think that  if you just put that product into the market, people will come, and people will  start using the product.

In my experience, that's not really how the world works.

If  you start a startup or a company that's aimed to be a startup, growth is  important because that's actually what a startup is.

If you make something that has the  potential to be really big, then making that really big is sort of what a  startup is all about. There's actually a post that Paul Graham wrote that is called  "startup equals growth" where he talks about specifically why growth is so important for startups  and why it's not important, why not every company is a startup, or why growth  isn't important for every company, but for startups, it's really, really important.

I'll talk in  a second and sort of like what it means to be intentional about growth, but  the first question you kind of have to answer yes to is sort of like  I have a startup, I want to grow, now, how do we go about doing  that? Who is this talk for? In my experience, the kind of things you work  on when you work on user growth started with consumer companies. Those were the kind  of companies that started embracing a lot of the tactics and strategies and technologies that  growth teams were doing. Now, I would argue that almost every company that sells anything  online or get users online should be or could be using a lot of the  skills and knowledge that I'm going to talk about today. You don't need to be  just consumer company. You don't need to be just a social network to apply these  things. These are applicable to a wide range of companies.

If you're a B2B company  and are excellent at growth, you have a massive advantage to other companies in your  space because they are probably not going to spend as much time doing growth as  you are. Now, there is one type of companies who this is relevant for but  too early.

That actually might apply to most of you right now, and this is  why this talk is dangerous because working on growth at the wrong time in your  company's history can be really, really bad for you.

It's sort of like when you  are kind of off to the races a little bit too ahead of time. The  most important thing, which is what a lot of lecturers here at Startup School is  about is how you make something people want and how you actually find a product  market fit.

If you apply a lot of the things that I'm going to talk  about here to a company that hasn't built something people want or haven't actually found  product market fit, really bad things happen. You will very often, and this is a  very common graph, grow like crazy in the beginning, but then when you realize that  sort of like that fuel that you had isn't fueling anything, it's just fuel that  kind of evaporates, you'll come straight down.

That's why it's dangerous, and then I can  go into more details about that in a second, of applying some of these things  before you actually have a product market fit. The first thing I'm talking about today  is going to be around measurement around product market fit because that's actually the most  essential part for continuing growth. Now, do growth teams have impact or are growth teams  sort of like ... How do you know that growth teams actually matter? How do  you know that these things matter? I'm going to talk about it as well.

I'm  going to talk about experimentation, but before I get there, I want to tell you  a story from Facebook. This is not a story I came up with myself.

I  found it on one of the talks from Facebook.

I think it's so essential for  describing the level of impact you can have if you are applying these kind of  skillsets to a company. This is the timeline of Facebook from 2004 to 2015.

It's  sort of their growth story. Some of this is public. Some of this wasn't. The  one thing Facebook had, they had an excellent data science team from the early days.  They were really good at measuring, sort of like forecasting how big Facebook was going  to be. So back in 2006, 2007, when Facebook has just started the growth team,  they had a bunch of data scientists doing this sort of forecasting. How big will  Facebook eventually be? They looked at all the type of metrics that Facebook had, and  they came to the conclusions that Facebook will be roughly be 400 million users by  2015.

That was their forecast by using all the data they had. We know that  wasn't really true. They actually started growing really fast in 2008, 2009. This actually, as  a result of something the growth team came up with. Anyone here had an idea  of what would make Facebook grow so fast in 2008, roughly 2007, 2008?
Audience: Didn't they open it to high school students?
Gustaf A.: Opening to high school students. Yes, they did, but that wasn't as big of a  growth. Newsfeed was 2005. Sorry? Recession. Recession did not. No. 10 friends on ... Yeah.  That's good.

That's sort of like the growth story all across.
Audience: Image tagging.
Gustaf A.: Image tagging. Could've been that.
Audience: [inaudible] .
Gustaf A.: Translations is the answer. So this is surprising for many of you might, maybe, but  this is actually core part of many growth teams is that you want to make  your product available for as many people in the world, and Facebook started sort of  hitting the limit on people that spoke English, and then assumed that people, just because  Facebook was in English and ... Sorry.

That the content were in your local language  and Facebook were in English, it would continue to scale.

That wasn't the case. They  implemented this new platform that automatically translated Facebook into hundreds of languages, and the growth  re-accelerated. Now the some thing started happen again.

I think they call this lockdown. They  were doing very important things.

In 2010, 2011, something very big was happening, and Facebook  had to make some really large changes, to some extent also driven by using data  to figure out these things. Any idea what happened in 2010? It was a really  big acceleration. Mobile.

I heard mobile. So actually what happening is that the data scientists  at Facebook were forecasting Facebook to be about 700 million users, something like that. Because  most of those people using Facebook on computers, they hadn't intended this massive shift that  was happening in 2010, 2011, which is people getting a smartphones. Facebook switching the entire  team, they had even have large training classes for engineers to start learning mobile. This  was the big change that happened then.

And then actually one more thing happened sort  of like in 2013, 2014 where they made a forecast, they were kind of not  hitting the ceiling of growth again, but then something again happened. Any idea what happened  sort of 2013, 2014?
Audience: [inaudible] .  Instagram.  Instagram [inaudible] .
Gustaf A.: Instagram and Whatapps could be good answers.

That's not what I'm looking for here.
Audience: Messenger.
Gustaf A.: Messenger is a good answer.

It's not what I'm looking for. So Facebook actually running  into the ceiling of the internet, the number of people actually that were online, so  they started this thing called internet.org, which was intended to get more people online. They  went to carriers. They basically worked with carriers to get people online to get free  Facebook. This is actually where a very important portion of the continuous growth of Facebook.  Now, what can we learn from this? Well, we can learn that the initial forecast  of Facebook's growth was about 400 million people, but Facebook today is at 2 point,  I don't know, 1, 2.2 billion-user platform, so it's a very large platform, and the  forecast were wrong. Now, the forecast wasn't wrong.

It just didn't intend to take into  account everything great that the company was going to do.

If there's anything we can  learn from this is that if you're intentional growth and you are really trying to  break through these forecasts and these ceilings, you can grow really, really fast. This applies  to every company.

I show this graph to everyone that joined Airbnb and be like  everyone that joined growth team at Airbnb and try to get them to think in  the same way. So natural adoption, which is sort of like that initial forecast of  how fast your project's growing without any of that work, is always going to eventually  slow down, but if you do the things that you do as a growth team,  you can't continue to push the growth of your company. Now, I mentioned this before.  Having a growth teams before you find product and market fit isn't really useful. So  let's talk about product market fit.

It's a important term, but it's hard to exactly  define what it is. One way that I think about measuring product market fit is  these two things. First, you find the metric. You can do this for yourself after  this talk. Find the metric that represents the value that your customers get from your  product, and then you measure the repeat usage of that metric.

It sounds pretty simple,  and we'll see, let's see if it works. You can make this kind of table  if you want where you have the company, you have the metric that represents the  value users get from your product and then you have the idea of frequency. So  let's take Airbnb. You get value from Airbnb when you are booking and staying, so  when you're actually traveling Airbnb, that's when you find that Airbnb is really valuable.

It's  amazing experience. Unfortunately, people don't do that more than annually, so if you want to  figure out the product market fit of it, Airbnb, you can always ask people after  their first stay, but you wouldn't really know until they book again. When they come  back and book again. Because the booking cycles for traveler's so slow, annual would be  a good metric here. Let's take Facebook. So Facebook, if you come back to Facebook  being and voluntarily coming back to Facebook, as an active user, you're doing that because  you find value.

That's something that makes you come back to Facebook or Instagram or  anything like that.

And the question then is how often should I come back? Well,  probably daily or hourly or something like that. They started looking at monthly, and then  they went down to daily.

I think they might be even going more than that.  Let's talk about Gusto.

What's the product value as a customer of Gusto that you  get out of using Gusto? Well, when you run your payroll, which is what sort  of what Gusto do for your employees, this is one of best ways to measure  the value you get out of Gusto, and how often do you do that? Well,  you run payroll every other week or every month.

I'm not going to go into  the details of all of this, but for Lyft, it might be rides. For Checker,  it might be background checks. For Stripe, it might be transactions. Now, for your company,  you should figure out what is the one metric that I can measure easily, every  day or every time it happens, and what's the ideal frequency through which that should  happen? If you can answer those two questions, you can make a cohort analysis of  your own company right now and you can start trying to figure out if you  have product market fit. Then, you want to measure these things, so you take a  graph. On one axis you have time, and the other one you have the metric  that we just decided. From that, you can try to figure out if you have  a product market fit This company is measuring this on a weekly basis. The ideal  use case of this company is using this product on a weekly basis, so every  week here, there's a dot, which is the percent of people that use this product  on Week One. The first time they used it, they used it again. Let's take  Startup School as an example. So I join Startup School, and in Week One, only  60% would come back to Startup School, and then in Week Four, only 30% would  come back. Well, that would suggest that Startup School, we wouldn't be a great product,  but that would be a good way to measure if Startup School is actually a  good product. People come back to all the content that we're creating.

I'll take another  product. This is a great product. This is kind of like a normal product ...  an old product would like because almost always, you have a little bit too many  people in the beginning of the product, and then it will go down over time,  but it will sort of flatten out where you keep measuring these events of your  metrics. This might sound technical, but it's actually just a representation of how many people  each dot it is, how many people that's using your product for that metric that  you decided on that time window. Most good products flatten out. Let's look at some  examples here. So these are examples that based on payment retention. This is a company  that you have all heard of that retains 10% after one month, and then 12%  after 12 months.

It's sort of like unusual. Who can that be?
Audience: [inaudible] .
Male: Stripe.
Gustaf A.: This is too hard. This is Shopify. Shopify have this product where a lot of  people sign up, not that many people continue in Month Two, but then they kind  of stick on forever.

What do we know from this? Well, if this curve would  go down to zero or sort of keep going down, then Shopify would be a  bad product.

It wouldn't be something that actually found product market fit and shouldn't be  working on growth.

In this case, they have good product market fit, and they should  be working on growth. They should do all they can to continue working on growth.  They should do something about the initial onboarding here where they lose a lot of  people in the beginning, but they should be working on growth. Here's another company. 50%  retention after one month, and then 10% after 24 months. Sort of similar to Shopify,  but they continue to lose users all the way down to even 24 months. Maybe  there's some flattening out at the very end here, but even 12 months after people  start paying for this product, every month, fewer and fewer pay for the product.

Is  this a product market fit? Hard to say, but it's not an obvious case that  they have found product market fit. So this is Blue Apron. Here's one that's pretty  good. 70% retention after 12 months, and then 30% after seven years. This company definitely  have a product market fit. Any ideas which company this might be? You're all using  it.
Audience: [inaudible] .
Gustaf A.: Amazon.

I heard Amazon, but it wasn't the right one.
Audience: [inaudible] .
Gustaf A.: Apple. No. This is Netflix. So 70% of people that start paying for Netflix, pay  for Netflix seven years down the line.

That's definitely a company with product market fit.  They should spend everything they can working on growth. Raise your hand if you're measuring  your retention right now. Not that many people. Well, there are other ways to figure  out retention.

If you're really small, you should go out and talk to users. You  should ask them questions such as, "How would you feel if you can no longer  use my product?" and should sort of like say as close as you can to  users. This is like measuring retention like this, it's very hard when you have 10  users. When you have 1,000, it's easier. But when you have 10 users, this is  not the way to do it. You can actually go and just talk to all  of them in person. There are other ways to measure it, but you sort of  have to know that you have a product that's retaining. Otherwise, you shouldn't be working  on growth because you're going to end up burning a lot cycles on things that  doesn't matter. A lot of people might be wondering how does growth and marketing relate  to each other? Is it the same thing, or how should I think about it?  Historically, the way you had a company 20 years ago is you had a product  team that made a product, and then you had the marketing team or product marketing  team that marketed the product.

That's how things used to work. A lot of hierarchies  in companies or organizations are still based on this idea that you had a product  team that's separate from the marketing team, and these are different teams and different skillsets,  and engineers work over in the product team, and then the marketing people work over  in the marketing team. Actually, it's not how things work anymore. The way you should  think about this is that, I'm going to come to this in a second, is  that there's three different types of people that can, organizations that can drive growth. There  is what I call a product growth engineering. This has different names. This is effectively  product managers, engineers, data scientists, and sometimes marketers that work on growth, but they work  on growth using technology. They're actively changing the product to drive more growth, and much  of this work here is about people that already arrived to your product but haven't  really found the value of your product, and they're changing the product to make it  grow faster. Conversion optimizations fall into this group. Some of the growth challenge actually fall  into this group. Now, there's this big other group here, performance marketing, which is effectively  Google and Facebook marketing, which is also super technical and super data-driven.

I would argue  that these things are very, very similar. Five or 10 years ago, you would go  to a company, you would see these being very different groups, maybe different floors in  the office. Now they, in my opinion, should sit together. So engineers should sit together  with performance marketers and vice versa because they actually are doing very similar things. Now,  there's this fifth button, fifth things should be number three here, which is brand marketing.  Brand marketing is sort of like the hardest to measure type of marketing where you're  not really having a direct response, you're not having someone directly giving you feedback on  how that marketing perceived. You can't even measure that very easily, so this is not  something that startups should be doing in the early days.

In my opinion, startups should  not be brand marketing until way down the line when they hit the limits on  these two things. Startups should be doing these two things, and there's some qualifications through  which you can do this, but almost everyone can do this.

If you're a startup,  you have engineers, you can do product growth or growth engineering or things like that.  All right. Let's talk about that first part, product growth. Your product is a funnel.  What does that mean? Your product has many, many, many steps betweens the first user  and the person sort of like completing what they're trying to do on your product.  Let's say I'm an e-commerce store, and I'm trying to buy something. There are many,  many steps in that funnel, and what the product growth team is working on is  funnel optimization or conversion rate optimization.

If you look at what we did at Airbnb  on the growth team, many of those growth teams were conversation rate, rate optimization teams  that are working a specific part of the funnel. So the funnel could start with  SEO, it could start with performance marketing, it could start with referrals of virality, but  it would jump through a number of different steps. Say signups would be a very  common step. Or if you're an e-commerce site, payment conversation or buying conversion. All of  these steps are things that as a conversation rate optimizing part of the growth team  should be working on. These are the some of the easiest things you got working  on.

I'm going to be a little bit high level here because to go into  depth about every single area here is going to be, we can go on for  hours. Some of the good ideas, some areas to start working on for conversation rate  optimizations, one of them is translation.

If you have an international product that's not translated,  you should be thinking about that.

That immediately drives more people to start using your  product. The second thing is authentication. Most of your products probably have some idea of  user accounts where you can sign up to your product and you can come back  and log into your product. You'd be surprised how much, how hard this is. From  Airbnb, I know we spent many years working on just authentication. Signing up and logging  in.

It sounds so simple, but it turns out that's a very fragile moment of  users sort of like flowing through your product, but you can always continue to make  optimizations.

If you go to Airbnb and you go to Pinterest today, assume that whatever  is there in terms of authentication is the most optimized version. These companies spend enormous  amount of time optimizing signup conversion. Another big area of for conversion rate optimization is  onboarding. So when I come to your product, what's the first thing I experience and  what can the product do to bring me towards the value of the product as  quickly as possible? Those are things that you work on when you're working on onboarding.  And then another big area here is purchase conversion, so sort of like when I'm  about to buy something, a product and actually can take the final decision around what  you do, there's so many things you can do here. All right. So then, there  is something called growth channels. So what is a growth channels? Growth channels is how  people discover your product. Now, when you're a small company, and I don't know how  big you guys are, but let's say you have less than 50 users. You shouldn't  really be thinking about growth channels. Even if you have less than 5,000 users, you  probably shouldn't be thinking about this because it's too early. But the things that you  do when you're small that don't scale have the word don't scale in it for  reason. They don't actually scale. There are very few companies who kind of grow big  without growing in one of these scalable growth channels. There are not that many platforms,  and the channel/platform can be used in the same way. There are not that many  things that are really, really big in the world on which you can build a  large company. Let's talk about what those channels are. The first thing here is basically  you think through the behavior of your product, and let's talk about the first one  here, which is, if the way I discover your product is a rare behavior, where  people use Google to find your solution. This is actually how very, a lot of  products in the world are being discovered.

If you have something through which to answer  the question around what you do, once a year, you go to Google, probably if  you're building a company trying to answer the question, you should be on Google. A  good example here might be buying a house. You aren't buying a house more than  once a twice in your entire house, which means when you go and buy a  house, you're probably going to go to Google, which is not surprisingly that something like  Zillow or Redfin or all those different sites that allow you to buy homes online  are entirely optimized for SEO and sometimes paid search.

If you are using something every  day, you're not going to go back to Google every day. You're going to go  to straight to that product. You're going to open the app on your phone. You're  going to go to the straight to the website, whatever it might be. You're not  going to go to Google anymore, just to kind of figure out which of the  different things I'm going to use. Now, Google is not the only search engine. There  are other search engine that you can optimize for as well, but Google is the  one this all matters. Next behavior. Do people of my product already share the product  using word of mouth? If that's the case, then there are lots of things you  can do around virality and referrals. You can grow your product by accelerating that behavior  from existing users. You can either incentivize them with referrals where you're getting paid or  you can do it for free with using virality techniques. Does having more users of  my product actually improve my experience? So what do I mean by that? Well, if  I am building the next LinkedIn, it makes sense the product is not as valuable  when it's just all of us on LinkedIn but when it's a bunch more people  and companies on LinkedIn, it makes sense that the value kind of increases. Well, in  that sense, you should absolutely continue to do virality because every single user is sort  of an opportunity to bring in more users. Here's another way to think about virality.  And then, this is the common question I ask companies in sort of the early  days of YC: can you make a list, literally a spreadsheet, of all the people  in the world that would use my product? Let's say I sell to buyers who  decides to ... Doctor's offices, sell to doctor's offices. Well, I can probably make a  list of all the doctor's offices in the United States or in California.

It wouldn't  be that hard.

It's totally possible. So I would find a way to make that  list and then would go out and do sales. This is surprisingly something, often, something  that you should start with.

If you can make the list, if you know who  those people are, you should do go and do sales. The last one here is  does my users have high LTV? Do I charge enough for my product for it  to be valuable? Well, then I should definitely go and do, pay the acquisition for  example, Google and Facebook.

I shouldn't do acquisitions or paid ads unless I actually am  charging for my product. All right.

I'm going to go through each one of these.  It's not going to be possible to go into super deep detail for all of  them, but I'm going to go into, a little bit deeper into some of them  and not the others. All right. Let's talk about referrals. So I worked on the  referral program at Airbnb for a very long time. The way to think about referrals  is sort of a engineered word of month. So if people are already talking about  your product, referrals is a way through which you can engineer more people talking about  your product. One way could be just making it easier. Another way could be by  using financial incentives. So in the Airbnb referral program, we had a financial incentive where  as a referrer, I would make $20 for every users I would sign up in  travel credit, and as a referee, I would get $40 as a new user of  Airbnb in travel credits. We would kind of start with that principle and then try  to get as many people what we call through our referral funnels as possible. You  notice I used the word funnel here again. Every product is a funnel. Even the  referral product, which is a sort of a product of itself, inside Airbnb, had its  own funnel.

I'm not going to go through all of these details, but the way  you think about something that's kind of engineering and product-led is that you break it  down into different steps, and then you measure every single one of these steps, and  then you kind of measure the conversion rate to the very end. The first step  here is weekly active users that saw the referral program. So how many users saw  the referral program? If I wasn't measuring this step, I wouldn't know how many people  did that. When we started measuring this step, and I've seen this with many other  companies who have a referral program, is that a small percentage of your active users  see the referral program. Well, how could you be expected to use it if you  can't see it? We started measuring this in the early days of Airbnb. Turns out  that there's a lot of opportunity of just telling people about you having a referral  program, but then there's all these opportunities to optimize through that funnel. There is people  sending invites, how many they send to, the conversion rate to new users, to new  guest, and finally to them booking their first 10 nights. Here's another display. This slide  is going to be available online afterwards, so you don't have to take notes or  photos. We kind of separate the funnel into even more detail, and we would continue  to optimize this for years. Like thus all matters a lot, and we would continue  to optimize for years.

I'm going to go through one example of sort of like  one of those conversion rate optimizations we did for the referral program. So here is  their referral invite email.

If someone else, if I invited someone ... One of you  guys, you would get one of these emails. The email would say, "Gustaf Alströmer invited  you to Airbnb. Gustaf sent you $40 on your first trip on Airbnb. You can  book a room, small loft. Just sign up by 25th of May, 2018," and then  there's a button they call "Accept invitation," and then there's a photo of me and  my name. Looks pretty good. Now, this email is result of dozens of experiments. Nothing  here is random. Everything here is for reason. Let's talk about that. The first one  is the subject line. The subject line has my name.

If it's sent to any  of my friends, that make them more likely to open it. The headline of the  email have a clear value.

It's very, very clear what this email is about. You'd  be surprised how many emails that don't have a clear headline and a clear of  value of what the email is about. This email is about that I sent you  $40 on your first trip on this website called Airbnb. This, which is "Sign up  by May 25th, 2018" is urgency. You should sign up by May 25th, 2018.

That's  the urgency that makes you actually go, that increases the chance of people who see  this email actually go and do it. The name here, "Accept invitation," it a sense  of exclusivity.

It doesn't say "Sign up" for a reason. Because sign up, anyone can  sign up. By accepting an invitation sends an idea of exclusivity. Finally, it has my  name, where I live, and how long I've been a user of Airbnb with my  photo.

That's really strong social proof that I endorsed this website.

I endorsed this product.  The way you think about this is sort of how you think about all of  conversation rate optimization.

It's a set of optimizations. Pay growth. This is one of the  areas I'm not going too deep into the [inaudible] here. The things that matter for  pay growth is that you shouldn't do it unless you have revenue. Too many companies  are buying ads when they don't have any revenue or know how they're going to  make any revenue.

That's a big mistake. You shouldn't be doing that.

If you have  revenue, there's a couple of concepts that really matter. The first one: how much money  am I paying for each new users that I'm acquiring? It's called customer acquisition cost  or CAC.

What's lifetime value or payback time of the users that I have acquired  through pay growth? What that means is: what's the longest that I can, with some  level of accuracy, forecast how much these users will be worth? If a user is  paying $10 per month, and then we can have this cohort analysis that we had  in the beginning [inaudible] retention, we can figure out exactly how much our user's going  to be worth.

If my customer acquisition cost is lower than my lifetime value, then  that's good.

That means you have a great payback time.

If you only pay $20  for a user, that means if you make $10 per month, you have probably around  two months payback time.

It's more complicated than that, but it's sort of like a  simplified version. These are the most important concepts to keep in mind for pay growth.  Attribution. This matters if things get complicated.

If using both Google and Facebook, if you  get into some level of scale, you need to understand what it means to attribute  a new paid user to the dollar that you spent.

I'm not going to go  too much into detail what this means, but this is something that you should learn  if you're spending time on pay growth. Finally, in my opinion, there are only four  channels to manage that scale: Facebook, Instagram, Google and YouTube. These are the very, very  large pay growth channels through which many companies are actually built on these days. One  of the unspoken truth in my opinion is that a lot of the free channels  of growth is going down, and the pay channels are going up. A good example  of that is that it's hard to grow on the Facebook newsfeed unless you're paying  Facebook money. Same is true for Instagram.

It's sort of changing always. When there's a  new platform, they often kind of promote free users in the beginning, and then they  start to monetize that.

That's sort of what's happening for both Facebook, Google, and Instagram  today. All right. Search engine optimization. Search engine optimization or SEO. Some people might say  well, this is something of the past.

In my experience, it is not.

It still  matters because as long as we go back to Google to make our decisions about  what we're going to do in the future, this matters. Google is probably one of  the largest websites in the world.

It's a big deal. The one thing you should  know about SEO is that there's a difference between what you see on a website  and what Google see. Google can't view images. Google can't view JavaScript very easily.

If  you go to Airbnb and you see all of this, just remember that Google can't  see this. So if you're trying to communicate to someone who's searching for Stockholm on  Google or apartments in Stockholm, this is not what going to be delivered back to  Google. Google is going to see a bunch of lines of text that which you  had marked out in your code, and that Google have hopefully indexed, if you've done  the right thing.

And if you haven't, then it's going to like your fault. So  there are a bunch of basics that you can do with SEO, you just have  to get right. The easiest thing you can do is to run your website through  an SEO browser and try to figure out if you only saw this, would you  understand what your product is about? So using clear language, not in JavaScript to describe  what your product does is the most basic things you can do for SEO. There's  two different areas of optimization for SEO. This is as high level as it gets.  At Airbnb, there's a team of 20 people working on this of which 12 or  13 are engineers. This is a really, really big deal, but this is sort of  at the high level. There's two types of optimizations for SEO. There are things that  you can change on your website, and there are other people in the world that  link into your websites. This is the two main leverage that you have on SEO.  For the on-page optimization, the right way to start is not to start with like,  "Oh, let's make some changes." The right way to start is with a strategy.

What  am I trying to rank for? What key words exist on Google today that I  might want to be the number one result for? Now, to do that, you have  to do what's called a keyword analysis or a keyword research. You have to try  to figure out what are all the things that people are searching for that might  relate to my product? And then hopefully, they have some amount of large volume that  they're searching for, and then I can try to say well, these keywords that have  a medium to high volume and they're not that much competition around these keywords, those  are the ones I want to rank for. When you decided that, the other areas  around page optimizations now are easier because now you know what you're trying to rank  for. At scale, but I've seen this at small scale too, SEO at this point  is about SEO experimentation, which means you can do the set of best practices in  SEO.

It might take you to be a decent size company. But if you want  to become a massive company, a really, really large company who's growing through SEO, you  have to use experimentation to make those decisions. The other thing that matter here is  off-page optimization: who's linking to you. There are lots of tools you can use to  figure out who are all the websites online that links to you.

What's their sort  of domain, authority? Are they actually authoritative on the web to have something that's ...  There's a huge difference if I would link to your website or if The New  York Times link to your website.

It matters a lot in how, in Google's perception  of your site. One surprising way that Airbnb is that we had a lot of  press, a lot of people in the world for media would come and write about  Airbnb.

That was surprisingly important for our off-page optimizations.

If you have people writing about  you, either in press or in other areas, that's actually a great thing.

If you  don't have anyone writing about you, well, you're not going to have that many links  because the web have changed. There aren't that may links anymore.

It's not like everyone  have a website these days that are linking to each together. These are things have  changed. You have to be strategic about who are you getting links from. The easiest  way you can do is whenever you get written up by anyone, press or whatever,  just ask them to link to you.

It matters to you. The last thing I  want to talk about here is on growth teams. A growth team today is typically  engineers, data scientists, designers, product managers, end user researchers. These are not all the people  that you might have in your company today, but these are the companies that you'll  have when you start making decisions around growth. The way you organize a growth team  is there's sort of two options. You either have the growth team as its own  team and the rest of the product is the product team. The challenge here is  that when you're a small company and you're not kind of like somewhat ignorant about  growth, what [inaudible] often say like, "I've hired a growth engineer.

I hired growth product  manager.

That person is going to be doing all the growth in the company." That's  sort of not really a recipe for success.

It's kind of a fine balance between  saying everyone is responsible for growth, which doesn't work and having a small team that  is responsible for all the growth. You kind of have to find a balance here.  The right way to find that balance is to set very clear goals and very  clear dividing lines in your product. A good example here might be everyone that works  in the core product, which is sort of the value of your product ... Let's  say I am Gusto, the ... Running payroll for employees is the core product. Now,  everyone trying to get to that experience that sort of like the growth area of  Gusto. So that would be one easy way to make distinction between growth and product.  How do you decide what to work on? You make a simple calculation of what's  the effort, what's the minimal viable thing I want to try here, and sort of  how big of an outcome can that be? Always try to forecast out the outcomes  before you actually start doing the work because if you're forecasting something and at best  case scenario, it's small, you shouldn't be doing it, even though it's a low effort.  All right.

I have two small short sections left of this talk. The first one  is called making decisions.

If you ask any product manager at Airbnb today, "What is  the most important tool or learning that you learned at Airbnb that you'll apply to  your next thing?" they will say experiment or experiment framework or some way of making  A/B test inside the company.

I'm so happy that Suhali is talking later because I  stole a quote from his investor deck that I found online. This is the quote:  most of the world will make decisions by either guessing or using the gut. They  will either be lucky or wrong.

If you keep making decisions without using data and  experimentation, you will be lucky or wrong. This is a huge problem.

If you kind  of get to a scale of Airbnb or something even smaller than that, then every  decision you're going to make that you don't use A/B testing for, you won't actually  know what the full, true outcome of that decision might be. At Airbnb, we use  experimentation and A?B testing for every single major decision in the entire company. This is  how that tool worked at Airbnb.

I'm going to talk sort of like more about  how that looked like. Let's say in your company, you decide to ship a feature.  This is how many measurements of that metric per day and the Wednesday here is  when I ship them in the future. They'll look at it two weeks later, and  it looks at that, the metric of that feature went up, so it's a good  thing, right? Well, it's not that easy because there are so many more different factors.  Who knows what happened between here? If you're a soccer app and the World Cup  just started, well, then, you wouldn't know if the features had made a difference.

If  this was just peak season of whatever you're doing, this is a school app, education  app, and this is September, then you wouldn't know either. So the only way you  would know is what's called a counterfactual. Basically an A/B test. By running two different  versions of the same feature, the same site, the same time, you would be able  to know what the true difference between making this decisions and not making it was.  This might sounds a bit technical, but it's very, very important to internalize because you  will get to a point where you were successful up until that point and you  think that you are so good at making these decisions, and then they get harder  to make. You have to have a framework to make these decisions. Because this is  so important at Airbnb, we built something we call experiminterview. Experiminterview is when the whole  growth team would meet in a room like this, would go through all the features  that we had recently built, and before we told you which of the different features  in the experiment that actually won, we'd ask the audience. So I'm going to do  that with you guys here. Here's a photo of a experiminterview. We would do this  every two or three weeks.

It's really fun. But it drove home this one thing,  which is that making product decisions are really hard. All right. Let's get started. The  goal of this product was to increase the number of shares from the Airbnb mobile  app, specifically the number of shares of listings. Back at that time, we had two  options. We had the native share sheet that you'll know about, and then we have  this experiment share sheet, which take up the entire screen and has more colors. The  same type of buttons, sort of. You can see the difference here. Now, before I  show the answer, how many here think that the native share sheet led to more  shares? Raise your hand.

It's about half the room. How many here thought that the  new share sheet that one of our engineers built drove more shares? Raise your hand.  So many hands did not raise.

I'm assuming you guys think there was no difference.  Because this is so hard, you have to make a decision. You have to make  a decision. You have to have an opinion.

If you don't have an opinion here,  you're basically saying, "I can't decide," so. This share sheet led to 40% more shares.  It's very important in this case that we use experimentation because if we had just  gone by our gut, we would've been wrong. Half of the room, more than half  of the room would've been wrong. Let's do one more. So we sent out this  email to existing users of Airbnb to sort of ... When I would make a  booking at Airbnb, we sent out this email to the people that I listed as  my co-travelers, and the email will look in the control like this, where it would  have the itinerary, the address to that listing, and the button on that email would  say, "Join Gustaf's trip." Now we tried a new version where the email looked a  little bit different, less content, and then we have a different button here called "Accept  Gustaf's trip invitation." The goal here was to get signups, so people have to click  on this button, and then sign up. How many here think that "Join Gustaf's trip"  in the control led to more signups? Raise your hand. Some people. How many here  think that "Accept Gustaf's trip invitation"? Raise your hand.

That's good. How many here think  that there was no difference? So this is a 14% increase of just changing the,  basically name of the button. Let's try one more for simplicity.

In this case, now  they're sharing experiments.

I'm kind of giving you the very easy-to-understand ones. The control here  was sort of like a bunch of sharing options on the Airbnb listing. We had  some Twitter icons, the Facebook icons, the email icons. We had another version of that,  which the icons were round.

And then we have one that was called, sort of  square buttons, and it was just displaying email and Facebook, and then they can click  on more. How many here thought, if the goal was sharing ,that the control with  the icons won? Raise your hand. Some people. How many here thought that the round  buttons were better? Raise your hand. Some people. How many thought the square buttons? Wow.  You guys are really good. How many thought there was no difference? Well, both of  these were winners. This was, by far, the biggest winner. These are the kind of  things that we debated, and because we run experiments, you don't have to debate anymore.  Product decisions are really hard. At scale, you want to use experimentation, A/B testing to  make these decisions because otherwise, it'll be loudest voice in the room, they'll make decisions,  and you don't want that. To summary sort of my talk, if you're running a  startup, you should be thinking about growth. Before you start working on growth tactics, you  should be measuring your retention and knowing if people are using, repeatedly using your product.  You should pick a metric and then pick a goal for that metric and drive  that metric towards that goal. Very simple.

And then eventually, but not right away, you  should start running A/B tests for decisions that are hard to make.

In the early  days, decisions are not that hard to make because they might be obvious, but the  moment they're not easy anymore, you should be doing this with experimentation. Thank you.

I  think we have time for a couple of questions. Yes.
Audience: You said that experimentation is important for SEO. Do you have any frameworks or ways  you would think about trying experiments beyond just doing something randomly and then testing it  with A/B testing?
Gustaf A.: So the question was around experimentation and SEO. How do you go about doing that?  When you run an on-page experiment, what you're trying to test is the amount of  organic traffic you get from Google and how your ranking shifts. Google actually are changing  the rankings all the time, so if you make a big change on your website,  on say half ... Let's say, let's call you have for Airbnb's case, listing pages  ... Sorry. Search results pages. So Stockholm, London, San Francisco, we [inaudible] one group, and  then you have New York, Paris, and Barcelona be another group. You would change the  content on the first group of pages, but not the others. Within not too long  of a time, you would see more or less traffic going to either of these  groups from Google. Sometimes, there's no difference, but if there is a difference, you'll see  more traffic.

I'll give you an idea of a very small change you could make.  Let's, for example, change the title tag from "Airbnb listings" to "The 25 Top Best  Listings in Barcelona." One of them is going to rank better because it's going to  be more inviting to click on, and then you run that experiment towards the search  engine, and then the search engine will kind of tell you which one is better  based on the amount of traffic on the search engine that you get. Yes.
Audience: Let's say that we're totally bought in on the [inaudible] of A/B testing but are  very early-stage startup that like we don't have enough traffic. This is something that our  team debates is we want to A/B test, but it feels like it's not worth  the effort because the results would not be reliable. How do you, what guidance do  you have for navigating that transition?
Gustaf A.: So the question was around A/B testing. How do I determine if it's right for  me when I'm really early? So A/B testing is a function of change, so you  can have a medium to small-size audience.

If the change is large enough, is actually  can be significant. The numbers can be significant. Now, what you can do is you  go do, you can go to Google and type in A/B testing calculator. There's a  form will pop up, and you can type in the metric that you have, and  then the change. You could see how big the change have to be for you  to be able to see a difference. Now, if you're really, really small, you probably  shouldn't be doing A/B testing at all, so I would do A/B testing when you  have like enough traffic that you can see a medium to small-size change within, say,  two or three weeks. So I'd say a small change would be a couple of  percent.

If you can see that in a couple of weeks, kind of like that's  sort of the level you could be at.

That's probably my general recommendation.

I've certainly  seen a lot of companies that are early, embracing A/B testing relatively early, and then  have that guide their decision-making.

I don't think that's a bad idea because I think  that's much ...

It's better to start a little bit early than to start way  too late.

If those are the only two options. Of course, you start at the  right time. Yep.
Audience: How [inaudible] see growth in maybe high-barrier entry markets like health insurance?
Gustaf A.: How do apply growth to high-barrier entry market like health insurance? So I think you  should separate the acceleration of your growth in that market and the market itself.

If  it's hard to reach people, that means you have to probably try to reach a  lot more people before you actually get sort of a ...

If a high ...  Tell me what you mean by a high barrier.
Audience: Well, for example, there's a bit, with insurance, you have to do risk sharing, right?  And you have to have to a lot people [inaudible] in order for one person  to want to buy your product because it's kind of this [inaudible] but there's also  a pile of regulation and [inaudible] on top of it?
Gustaf A.: Yeah, so if you have a risk and regulation involved, I don't think that the  principle of growth changes, but if you're purely growing through sales, for example, you can  apply a lot of automation and technology to how to do sales.

If I'm a  company and I'm selling to insurance buyers at startups, I might be starting by emailing  10 people.

In fact, I can email 100 people or 1,000 people with the same  type of level of ... The email itself is kind of viewed as personal and  as direct to that receiver as if I send one email that I just wrote  myself. There's certainly things that you can apply to your growth that allows you to  reach a lot more people. Now, growth doesn't solve any of their risk challenges at  all.

It doesn't solve any kind of major market issues. Airbnb certainly had a lot  issues with legal challenges in different markets, and so the growth was disconnected from that.  That wasn't sort of our goal.

If you're a startup that have those problems, I  don't think you should solve them ... Solving them and solving growth are two different  things. They are very different from each other. Growth is a way to accelerate you  getting to more health insurance buyers.

It doesn't actually say anything whether that's a good  thing or a bad thing. Yeah.
Audience: Do you have any wisdom on using non-sustainable tactics [inaudible] market like Uber?
Gustaf A.: Do I have any wisdom of using non-sustainable tactics in new market like Uber? So  if you're doing things that don't scale, you sort of have two options. One is  they don't scale, so you should stop doing them eventually. Or you build a playbook  where you take those skills and kind of try them in a different city. Now,  they might not eventually scale, so let's say I am out manually to recruit Uber  drivers. Now that might be an unsustainable growth tactic.

It might be working for the  first 20 drivers, but eventually, it's not going to have high ROI in comparison to  say running ads on Facebook to recruit drivers.

I think you kind of have to  determine this manual thing that I'm doing in the very beginning, which is doing things  that don't scale, which is recruiting every single user to become a user of your  product, eventually won't work anymore, and you kind of have to find another channel, or  it won't be high ROI in comparison to the other channels. Most companies will go  through this transition period where you grow from, say, writing content manually to through engineering,  changing your website so that you get more search traffic, for example.
Audience: What about how they're doing lots of subsidies for rides?
Gustaf A.: What about doing subsidies or incentives for rides? Well, I actually think the incentives are  super scalable. Like at Airbnb, we still have the referral program. They're signing up, I  don't know hundreds of thousands of users every day almost, which, and large portion of  them are signing up through referrals, so that is an example where subsidies are actually  scalable. Now, me handing you a coupon in your hand is not scalable, but doing  that through an email system what through Whatapp or through Messenger or some other channel,  is actually scalable as long as you're not losing the money. You have to have  a very good ROI calculation on the money that you're handing out and knowing that  that's incremental money that if you didn't give that money, those users wouldn't actually start  using your product. So as long as you have a good handle on that, that  is totally fine. Yes.
Audience: We talked a lot about product marketing being [inaudible] mentioned that you have to achieve  that before you really invest in growth, so my [inaudible] an app where we have  3% of our users are paying for the premium features, but the other 97% are  using the free features, but [inaudible] of those guys are using it more than two  hours a day, so they really like those free features, [inaudible] aren't willing to pay  for the premium features. So how much of, like before we invest in that growth,  I guess how do we find what those free ... [inaudible] be could still achieve  [inaudible] growth?

Gustaf A.: The question was around they have two groups of users: the free users and then  the paying users, and some of them are very active, and some of them are  not as active, but at least they don't want to pay, how would use growth  there? One of the things I would try to figure out is what is the  retention rate of those paying users? Are they actually sticking around and using the product  that they're paying for? What's the retention rate for the free users? Do that change  once they start paying? And then I will look at conversions or like how, what  percentage of the free users am I converting to paid? There's many different ways to  that. There's one, which is having the freeman concept. You can also have a free  trail, which means you actually don't have freemen. You can just have a very limited  set of free users, and then they kind of have to go to paid. But  ultimately, to the extent that you should be growing all of this, comes down to  how much usage you have from these, the users that you value.

If the paid  users are the one you value the most, if they stop using your product after  three months, then you have a more fundamental problem than the conversation between these two  groups. So I would still go back to retention and look at usage for these  people and see: are they actually sticking around and using the product? Last question from  over here. Yes, in the back.
Audience: The only question I have a friend who is the head of the product growth  involved in a startup, and I was a little taken aback when this person told  me that experimentation is actually really hard for them.

Is there an ideal or a  healthy frequency for experimentation?
Gustaf A.: So the question is sometimes experimentation can be really hard to execute.

Is there an  ideal frequency or which experiment should I be actually be running? For something like a  marketplace, experimentation is really hard.

That is correct.

In that case, it's harder than just  setting up a simple tool online or using Mixpanel to set up your simple A/B  test.

It's more difficult than that.

If you are having a simple product funnel, it's  generally not that hard to set up experimentation if you have an engineer and if  you have a decent amount of traffic.

It's not that hard to set it up.  Now, there is different kind of products that make experimentation harder.

I think that if  you're at the stage where you have a lot traffic, in my opinion, you don't  have really an option. You sort of have to invest in some level infrastructure to  use data to make decisions.

If you don't do that, the alternative cost is you  end up making a lot of bad decision or either long or they're lucky. You're  lucky because they're right or you're wrong. So you don't really have an option, but  you run experiments.

It is true that there is some type of product through which  experimentation is easy.

If you're running a mobile app, experimentation is not that difficult. There  are lots of tools you can use to run experimentations.

If you're running out of  ideas for experiments, well, you should go back to user research and you should look  at other products that are ... Look at something like Pinterest or Airbnb or Facebook,  they're probably highly optimized, so a lot of the things in their funnels is there  for a very specific reasons because of A/B testing.

I don't have a better answer  than if you don't do it, you'll have a lot of other problems.

In terms  of the frequency, there is a cost to setting up an experiment, and that cost  should be minimized as much as possible. But it's sort of like you should try  to get better at it and pick the easiest, smallest thing that you can test,  and just test that.

If you have a big new feature you want to test,  well, just test the first part of that feature. Don't test all of it, and  see how people react to the first part of the feature.

I can talk for  hours about this, but thank you very much. (silence)
